## RECITALS

A. The Parties currently engage in a personal relationship and reside together (or intend to reside together) at **[Insert Property Address]** (the “Residence”).  
B. The Parties explicitly do not intend to be married, whether formally, statutorily, or by informal/common-law or analogous doctrines.  
C. Partner A is the sole Grantor, Trustee, and lifetime Beneficiary of the Trust, holding authority to utilize trust assets without breaching fiduciary duty to remainder beneficiaries.  
D. The Parties desire to define their respective financial rights, obligations, and property interests during their cohabitation and in the event their relationship terminates.  
E. The Parties acknowledge that withdrawals, substitutions, replacements, sales, transfers, or encumbrances of the Reference Assets during the term can impair transparent valuation, increase dispute risk, and make it difficult to determine what the Reference Assets’ values would have been at separation absent such actions. The Parties therefore agree to commercially reasonable valuation conventions intended to approximate such counterfactual values and deter opportunistic manipulation, and not to impose punitive damages.  
F. **Fixed Term.** The Parties intend this Agreement to have a fixed term of three (3) years beginning on the Execution Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Execution Date (the “Sunset Date”), unless renewed in a signed writing as provided herein.  
G. **Limited Scope; No Net Worth Representation.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that the “Reference Assets” identified in Article V are selected solely as a defined, contractually referenced valuation bucket for purposes of calculating the Separation Payout. The Reference Assets are not represented or intended to represent Partner A’s total assets, total net worth, total income, or total financial capacity. Partner B acknowledges that Partner A may own, control, or have interests in other assets and entities not listed as Reference Assets, and Partner B agrees that the Separation Payout is a specific bargain tied only to the Reference Assets (as adjusted under Article V), and not to Partner A’s total wealth.  
H. **Financial Summary Range Disclosure.** Partner A has provided Partner B a confidential “Financial Summary Range Disclosure” attached as Exhibit C, stating that Partner A’s assets (as defined therein) are in excess of **$[__________]**. Partner B acknowledges receipt of Exhibit C, acknowledges that the Agreement is not based on a full itemization of Partner A’s assets, and agrees that the Separation Payout is calculated solely by reference to the Reference Assets under Article V, regardless of any other assets Partner A may have.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein, the Parties agree as follows:

---

## ARTICLE I — DECLARATION OF NON-MARITAL STATUS & STRICT SEVERABILITY

### 1.1 No Marriage; Waiver of Informal/Common-Law Marriage Claims
The Parties explicitly declare they are not spouses, do not intend to be spouses, and have not represented themselves as such. They expressly waive any right to assert that a marriage exists or arose by informal/common-law marriage, “holding out,” or any analogous doctrine under the laws of any jurisdiction. Any cohabitation is solely for mutual convenience and companionship.

### 1.2 Strict Severability; Independent Consideration; Non-Meretricious Nature
(a) **No Meretricious Consideration.** The Parties expressly agree that no payment, benefit, or obligation under this Agreement is intended to compensate, secure, incentivize, or be exchanged for sexual relations, intimacy, romantic companionship, or the mere fact of cohabitation (“Meretricious Services”).  
(b) **Independent Consideration (Allocation of Consideration).** The Parties further agree that the economic terms of this Agreement—including the Monthly Support Payment (Article IV), the Relocation Severance (Section 7.3), and the Separation Payout (Article V)—are supported by lawful, independent consideration, including without limitation:  
(i) Partner B’s confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations (Article IX);  
(ii) Partner B’s waivers and covenants intended to prevent marriage-like claims and to protect Partner A’s separate property (including Sections 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 6.4);  
(iii) Partner B’s agreement to the dispute resolution framework and remedies (Article X) and the associated limitations and obligations imposed thereby; and  
(iv) Partner B’s agreement to provide releases and covenants not to sue as set forth in Section 9.5 (effective upon payment), which are material, bargained-for terms of this Agreement.  
(c) **Cohabitation Duration as Measurement Only.** To the extent any payout mechanic references time, duration, or “Days Cohabitated,” the Parties agree such reference is used solely as an objective measurement proxy to size and administer the Parties’ agreed risk-allocation, confidentiality exposure, transition costs, and releases/waivers described above, and shall not be construed as consideration for Meretricious Services or for the mere continuation of a romantic relationship.  
(d) **Construction Against Illegality.** If any tribunal were to construe any portion of this Agreement as involving Meretricious Services, the Parties direct that such construction shall be rejected, and the Agreement shall instead be construed, to the maximum extent permitted by law, as supported by the independent consideration described in Section 1.2(b) and enforceable accordingly.

### 1.3 Separate Property Maintained
All property owned by either Party prior to this Agreement, including all assets held by the Trust, shall remain the sole and separate property of that Party. No shared labor or household contributions shall create a constructive trust, resulting trust, or any equitable interest in the title or deed of any asset.

### 1.4 No Holding Out; Affirmative Conduct Covenants
(a) **No Holding Out.** The Parties shall not represent to any person or entity that they are married, spouses, husband/wife, or that they have agreed to be married.  
(b) **Third-Party Forms and Records.** The Parties shall not list one another as “spouse” on any form or record that reasonably could be construed as a representation of marriage, including but not limited to: employment records, benefits enrollment, health insurance forms, medical intake forms, school records, travel documentation, leases, mortgages, loan applications, government forms, or court filings.  
(c) **Taxes.** The Parties shall not file any tax returns as “married,” “married filing jointly,” or “married filing separately,” and shall not claim any status that requires marriage.  
(d) **Public Representations / Social Media / Introductions.** The Parties shall not (i) introduce each other to others as spouses, (ii) use honorifics implying marriage (e.g., “Mrs.” based on the other’s surname), or (iii) post or permit public content implying marriage, unless promptly corrected.  
(e) **Names and Titles.** Either Party may use the other Party’s surname socially only if not accompanied by any representation of marriage and if promptly clarified upon reasonable request.  
(f) **No “Spousal” Titling.** The Parties shall not title property or accounts in a manner that implies spousal status (e.g., “husband and wife,” “community property,” or similar).

### 1.5 Notice, Cure, and Cause for Holding Out
(a) **Holding-Out Notice.** If either Party reasonably believes the other Party’s statements or conduct create a material risk that a third party, tribunal, or agency could conclude the Parties are married or spouses under any informal/common-law or analogous doctrine (a “Holding-Out Risk”), that Party shall provide written notice describing the conduct and requested corrective action (“Holding-Out Notice”).  
(b) **Cure Period.** Within ten (10) days after receipt of a Holding-Out Notice, the recipient shall cure by taking all reasonably necessary corrective steps, which may include: written corrections to relevant third parties, amended forms, revised public posts, written clarifications to contacts, and any other action reasonably necessary to eliminate the Holding-Out Risk.  
(c) **Uncured Holding Out = Cause.** If the Holding-Out Risk is not fully cured within the cure period, such uncured Holding-Out Risk constitutes Cause under Section 7.4(c) and the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement for Cause by written notice (subject to Section 7.5).  
(d) **Equitable Relief Carve-Out.** Either Party may seek temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction solely to prevent or correct Holding-Out Risk conduct, without waiving arbitration on the merits.

---

## ARTICLE II — HOUSEHOLD COORDINATION & CONTRIBUTIONS (NON-EMPLOYMENT; FLEXIBLE SCOPE)

Partner A anticipates being the primary financial provider for shared household expenses during cohabitation. As a personal, non-commercial contribution to the shared household, Partner B may assist with household coordination and related tasks from time to time, as mutually convenient and as reasonably aligned with the Parties’ preferences.

### 2.1 Illustrative Areas of Assistance (Non-Exclusive)
Partner B’s assistance may include, when Partner B elects to do so:  
(a) Coordinating routine household logistics (e.g., scheduling, errands, supplies);  
(b) Communicating with vendors and service providers at Partner A’s request;  
(c) Helping organize household information (e.g., calendars, contacts, receipts) for convenience;  
(d) Supporting general upkeep planning for the Residence (e.g., identifying maintenance needs and coordinating service visits);  
(e) Assisting with dependent-related logistics when applicable (e.g., scheduling, transportation coordination), subject to availability and any agreed safety/privacy requirements.

### 2.2 No Duty to Perform; No Minimum Level of Service
The Parties acknowledge that the nature and extent of Partner B’s assistance may vary over time based on circumstances. No specific tasks, outcomes, hours, or performance metrics are required unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to a specific, time-limited project.

### 2.3 Delegation and Third Parties
Partner B may propose the use of third-party vendors or assistants for convenience or efficiency. Partner A retains final approval on budget and security-sensitive matters.

---

## ARTICLE III — BOUNDARIES, COMMUNICATION RHYTHMS, AND NON-COMMINGLING

### 3.1 Communication and Coordination (Reasonableness Standard)
The Parties may maintain a shared method for household coordination (e.g., a shared calendar, notes, or periodic check-ins). Requests will be handled on a reasonable-efforts basis and with reasonable notice when practicable.

### 3.2 Reasonable Notice; Respect for Personal Time
The Parties agree to use reasonable efforts to provide reasonable notice for non-urgent household requests and to respect one another’s personal time and sleep. The Parties may mutually agree informal preferences from time to time, but no fixed schedule, duty to respond, or service-level standard is created by this Agreement.

### 3.3 No Timekeeping; No Performance Metrics
The Parties expressly agree there is no requirement for timekeeping, daily reporting, quotas, deadlines, or employment-style supervision. Any organization of household information (receipts, vendor communications, summaries) is for convenience and may be provided upon reasonable request.

### 3.4 Autonomy and Manner/Means
Partner B retains discretion over whether and how to assist with household coordination, subject to any mutually agreed safety, confidentiality, and budget parameters.

### 3.5 Operating Account for Household Expenses
Partner A may provide Partner B access to a dedicated, Partner A-funded operating account or credit card (the “Operating Account”) strictly for shared household expenses, vendor invoices, and dependent logistics approved by Partner A.

### 3.6 Strict Separation of Funds & Non-Commingling
(a) **No Commingling.** Partner B shall not intentionally commingle funds from the Operating Account with Partner B’s personal funds, except for permitted De Minimis Advances under Section 3.7.  
(b) **No Unauthorized Personal Use.** Partner B shall not use the Operating Account for Partner B’s personal expenses.

### 3.7 De Minimis Advances (Practical Exception)
(a) **Cap.** Partner B may, without prior written authorization, use personal funds to pay urgent or minor household expenses up to **$[X]** per calendar month in the aggregate (“De Minimis Advances”).  
(b) **Documentation.** Partner B shall provide reasonable documentation (e.g., receipt or invoice) within a reasonable time after the expense is incurred.  
(c) **Reimbursement Timing.** Partner A shall reimburse documented De Minimis Advances within ten (10) business days after receiving documentation.  
(d) **Above-Cap Advances.** Amounts above the De Minimis Advances cap require Partner A’s prior written authorization unless advance authorization is impracticable due to urgent circumstances.

### 3.8 No Expectation of Reimbursement Beyond This Section
Except as expressly stated in Section 3.7 or approved in writing in advance, Partner B has no expectation or entitlement to reimbursement for personal expenditures.

---

## ARTICLE IV — MONTHLY SUPPORT PAYMENT; TAX MATTERS

### 4.1 Monthly Support Payment
Partner A shall provide Partner B a monthly payment of **$[Amount]** (the “Monthly Support Payment”) by electronic transfer. The Parties intend this payment to function as personal support between cohabitating adults and not as wages for employment; however, each Party acknowledges that tax characterization depends on facts and applicable law. The Monthly Support Payment is not conditioned on timekeeping or completion of any particular deliverable, and Partner B’s assistance described in Sections 2–3 is voluntary and not subject to employment-style performance metrics.

### 4.2 No Employment Relationship; Household Arrangement
The Parties intend Partner B’s activities described in Sections 2–3 are undertaken as part of a private cohabitation arrangement and not as an employer-employee relationship. Partner B retains discretion over manner and means (Section 3.4) and may propose the use of third-party vendors/assistants as reasonably necessary, subject to Partner A’s budget constraints and security requirements.

### 4.3 Tax Cooperation; No-Adverse-Position Covenant
Each Party shall consult independent tax advisers regarding reporting positions. The Parties shall not knowingly take inconsistent reporting positions designed to harm the other Party without first providing written notice and a good-faith opportunity to align positions based on professional advice.

### 4.4 Recharacterization and Compliance (If Required by Law)
If any taxing authority or court determines any portion of payments under this Agreement constitutes taxable compensation or triggers household employment obligations, the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to:  
(a) correct filings as legally required (including issuance of any required forms);  
(b) allocate legally required employer/employee portions consistent with applicable law; and  
(c) implement a compliant prospective structure going forward, without affecting the validity of the remainder of this Agreement.

### 4.5 Tax Indemnification and Allocation of Risk
(a) **Partner B’s Tax Responsibility.** Partner B acknowledges and agrees that they are solely responsible for reporting and paying any applicable local, state, or federal income taxes owed on the Monthly Support Payment, the Relocation Severance, and any Separation Payout received under this Agreement. Partner A shall not withhold any taxes from such payments unless legally mandated by a final agency determination.  
(b) **Allocation Upon Recharacterization.** In the event any taxing authority or court issues a final determination recharacterizing the Parties’ arrangement as an employment relationship:  
(i) **Employer Taxes:** Partner A shall be solely responsible for any retroactive statutory employer-side taxes (e.g., employer FICA, FUTA) and related employer penalties.  
(ii) **Employee Taxes:** Partner B shall be solely responsible for any retroactive statutory employee-side taxes (e.g., employee FICA, standard income tax withholding) and related employee penalties.  
(c) **Indemnification.** Partner B shall indemnify and hold Partner A harmless from any amounts (including interest and penalties) that a taxing authority finally determines are legally payable by Partner B (including employee-side FICA, employee-side payroll withholding liabilities, and Partner B’s income tax), but only to the extent such amounts are (i) assessed against Partner A and (ii) actually paid by Partner A. Partner A shall provide Partner B reasonably prompt written notice of any such assessment and reasonable documentation of payment, and Partner B shall reimburse Partner A within thirty (30) days after receipt.

### 4.6 Tax Reporting Intent (Schedule 1, Line 8z “Other income”)
(a) **Intent; Not Binding on Authorities.** The Parties acknowledge that tax treatment is governed by applicable law and may be determined by taxing authorities based on the facts and circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties state their current intent for consistent reporting purposes as set forth in this Section 4.6.  
(b) **Monthly Support Payment Reporting Intent.** The Parties intend that Partner B will report the Monthly Support Payment as taxable ordinary income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Line 8z (“Other income”) (or the substantially similar line on any successor form), with a description such as “Cohabitation support” or “Support payment.”  
(c) **Relocation Severance and Separation Payout Reporting Intent.** The Parties intend that any Relocation Severance and any Separation Payout paid under this Agreement will likewise be reported by Partner B as taxable ordinary income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Line 8z (“Other income”) (or successor), with a description such as “Relocation severance” and/or “Separation payout” (or “Contractual separation payment”).  
(d) **No Withholding; Estimated Taxes.** The Parties acknowledge that amounts reported as “Other income” generally are not subject to wage withholding. Partner B shall be solely responsible for any required estimated tax payments and for timely reporting of such income on Partner B’s returns.  
(e) **No Deduction Intended.** The Parties intend that Partner A will not claim any business deduction for the Monthly Support Payment, Relocation Severance, or Separation Payout.  
(f) **Information Returns.** The Parties do not intend that Partner A will issue a Form W-2 or Form 1099 with respect to payments under this Agreement unless required by a final determination of a taxing authority or otherwise legally required.  
(g) **Conforming Changes if Required by Law.** If any taxing authority or court determines that any portion of payments under this Agreement must be reported differently (including as wages, household employment compensation, or self-employment income), the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to make legally required corrections (including any required forms) and to implement a compliant prospective structure, consistent with Section 4.4 and Section 4.5.

---

## ARTICLE V — CONDITIONAL SEPARATION PAYOUT & VALUATION MECHANICS

### 5.1 Contractual Right Only
To provide Partner B with financial security without granting ownership in Partner A’s separate property, Partner A agrees to pay Partner B a contractual lump-sum cash settlement (the “Separation Payout”) upon termination of cohabitation, subject strictly to the conditions below. This does not convey any ownership, equitable interest, security interest, lien, partition right, or title claim in any asset.  

**Independent Consideration for Separation Payout.** The Parties agree that the Separation Payout is contractual consideration for the independent obligations and protections in Articles I, VI, IX, X, and Section 9.5 (including confidentiality, waivers, and releases), and not consideration for Meretricious Services or for the mere fact of cohabitation. For avoidance of doubt, the Separation Payout is not intended to approximate Partner A’s total wealth; it is a limited-scope bargain tied only to the Reference Assets (Article V) and the independent consideration described in Section 1.2(b).

### 5.2 Bonus-Reference Assets & Baseline Value
The Payout calculation references the following Trust assets (“Reference Assets”):  
(a) **Real Estate:** [Insert Full Address] (Baseline Initial FMV per Exhibit A).  
(b) **Brokerage Account:** [Insert Account #] (Baseline Initial Value per Exhibit B).  

The “Aggregate Initial FMV” equals the sum of the Reference Assets’ baseline initial values.

(c) **Limited Reference Assets; No Net Worth Representation; Non-Reliance**  
(a) Limited Reference Bucket Only. Partner B acknowledges and agrees that the Reference Assets listed in Section 5.2(a)–(b) are the only assets used to calculate the Separation Payout under this Agreement (subject only to the adjustments expressly stated in Article V). No other assets, accounts, entities, income streams, business interests, trusts, inheritances, or property of Partner A (whether now owned or later acquired) are included in, or shall affect, the Separation Payout unless expressly added as Reference Assets by a signed written amendment.  
(b) No Representation of Total Net Worth. Partner B acknowledges and agrees that the Reference Assets do not represent Partner A’s total net worth, total assets, total income, or total financial capacity. Partner B expressly acknowledges that Partner A may have additional assets and interests beyond the Reference Assets, and that Partner B enters into this Agreement with that understanding.  
(c) Non-Reliance. Partner B represents and warrants that Partner B is not relying on any statement, implication, or representation by Partner A regarding Partner A’s total net worth or overall wealth as a basis for entering into this Agreement, except as expressly stated in Exhibit C. Partner B further acknowledges that the Separation Payout is a negotiated, limited-scope bargain based on the Reference Assets and the independent consideration described in Section 1.2(b), and not a promise of proportional participation in Partner A’s total wealth.  
(d) No Expansion by Equity Theories. Partner B agrees that the existence, discovery, or later disclosure of any additional assets of Partner A shall not, by itself, provide any basis to expand, reform, or recalculate the Separation Payout beyond the Reference Assets, nor create any claim to Partner A’s separate property, except to the extent a tribunal determines such expansion is expressly required by non-waivable law.

(d) **Financial Summary Range; Acknowledgment; No Duty to Update**  
(a) Financial Summary Range Provided. Partner B acknowledges that Partner A has provided the Financial Summary Range Disclosure attached as Exhibit C (the “Range Disclosure”), and that the Range Disclosure states a minimum asset level for Partner A as of the Execution Date.  
(b) Purpose and Effect. The Parties agree the Range Disclosure is provided solely to confirm that Partner B understood at signing that Partner A’s overall wealth may substantially exceed the Reference Assets, and to reinforce that the Separation Payout is calculated solely by reference to the Reference Assets (as adjusted under Article V), regardless of Partner A’s other assets.  
(c) No Continuing Update Obligation. The Parties agree Partner A has no obligation to update Exhibit C after the Execution Date, and fluctuations in Partner A’s assets after the Execution Date shall not affect the Parties’ bargain regarding the Reference Assets and Separation Payout.  
(d) Confidential Information. Exhibit C and the information contained therein constitute Confidential Information under Article IX.  
(e) Fraud Carve-Out (Non-Waivable Rights). Nothing in this Agreement waives any claim arising from an intentional, material misrepresentation within Exhibit C itself, to the extent such waiver is prohibited by applicable law.

(e) **Excluded Assets; Express Waiver of Claims; No Equitable Expansion**  
(a) Excluded Assets Defined. “Excluded Assets” means all property, assets, accounts, securities, real estate, business interests, entity interests, trusts, income streams, and other rights of Partner A other than the Reference Assets expressly listed in Section 5.2(a)–(b), whether owned now or acquired in the future, and whether titled in Partner A’s individual name, held through entities, or held in trust (other than the Reference Assets).  
(b) No Claim to Excluded Assets. Partner B irrevocably waives and relinquishes, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any and all claims or rights of any kind in or to the Excluded Assets, including without limitation any claim based on cohabitation, contribution, reliance, expectation, equity, or fairness.  
(c) No Equitable Theories. Without limiting subsection (b), Partner B expressly waives any right to assert any constructive trust, resulting trust, equitable lien, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, implied contract, implied partnership, joint venture, community property, transmutation, or similar theory seeking any interest in the Excluded Assets.  
(d) No Recalculation Based on Net Worth. Partner B agrees that no discovery or disclosure of Excluded Assets shall be grounds to expand, reform, or recalculate the Separation Payout beyond the Reference Assets, except to the extent a tribunal determines such relief is required by non-waivable law.  
(e) Fraud / Non-Waivable Rights Carve-Out. Nothing in this Section waives any claim based on an intentional, material misrepresentation within Exhibit C itself, or any rights that cannot be waived as a matter of applicable law.

### 5.3 Payout Components
Subject to Vesting (Article VII), the Separation Payout equals:  
(a) **Base Accrual Component:** A notional credit equal to 1.00% of the Aggregate Initial FMV per year cohabitated, pro-rated for partial years based on Days Cohabitated ÷ 365, capped at 3.00% total at the Sunset Date.  
(b) **Appreciation Component:** 35% of the Net Appreciation of the Reference Assets.  

“Net Appreciation” = (Adjusted Final Value – Adjusted Initial Value – Actual Liquidity Costs).  
“Adjusted Initial Value” = the Aggregate Initial FMV.  
“Adjusted Final Value” = the sum of:  
(i) the Real Estate Adjusted Final Value determined under Section 5.4(a) (as modified by Section 5.5, if applicable), plus  
(ii) the Brokerage Adjusted Final Value determined under Section 5.4(b) and Section 5.5(g).

### 5.4 Valuation at Separation
(a) **Real Estate Final FMV (as of Separation Date).** If the Real Estate Reference Asset remains owned and has not been subject to a Removal Event (as defined in Section 5.5) prior to the Separation Date, its final fair market value (“Real Estate Final FMV”) shall be determined by the average of two (2) appraisals by credentialed residential real estate appraisers, one selected by each Party. If the two appraisals differ by more than 10%, a third credentialed appraiser will be selected by mutual agreement (or by the arbitration administrator’s appointment). The third appraisal will be the tie-breaker and shall be final. Costs for the tie-breaker shall be split 50/50. Real Estate Adjusted Final Value shall equal the Real Estate Final FMV unless Section 5.5 applies due to a Removal Event, in which case the Real Estate Adjusted Final Value shall be determined under Section 5.5.  
(b) **Brokerage Account Final Value (as of Separation Date).** The account value as of market close on the Separation Date (evidenced by custodian statements) shall be the “Brokerage Final Value” for purposes of applying Section 5.5(g).  
(c) **Separation Date (Defined).** “Separation Date” means the earliest of:  
(i) the date Partner B vacates the Residence as their primary residence with intent not to return and surrenders keys/access credentials (if any);  
(ii) the 30th day after Partner A delivers a written notice terminating cohabitation and demanding vacatur (“Notice of Termination”), if Partner B remains beyond such 30 days;  
(iii) the date the Parties execute a written, mutual separation memorandum specifying a Separation Date;  
(iv) Partner A’s death (as further addressed in Section 8.1); or  
(v) the date either Party files a pleading or sworn statement in any proceeding asserting the Parties are married or were informally married or analogous.  
(d) **Permitted Logistics Period.** If Notice of Termination is delivered but the Parties remain temporarily under the same roof solely for logistics (packing, childcare transitions, travel timing, or security), the Separation Date shall still be determined under Section 5.4(c).  
(e) **Valuation Timestamp.** Values shall be determined as of the Separation Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Section 7.7(c)(iii) controls in the event of expiration without renewal, and in that case the Valuation Timestamp for purposes of Article V shall be the Sunset Date.  
(f) **Anti-Gaming.** Neither Party may unreasonably delay appraisal access, custodial statement production, or other actions necessary to determine values as of the Separation Date.  
(g) **Disputed Separation Date.** If disputed, the alleged Separation Date asserted by the Party seeking payment shall control only to initiate appraisal/statement gathering, but the final Separation Date shall be determined in arbitration. Partner A shall timely pay any undisputed portion pending resolution.

### 5.5 Anti-Withdrawal and Anti-Substitution Adjustment (Simple Rule)
5.5(a) Principle (What happens if the Reference Assets are “touched”). If during the term Partner A (i) withdraws, transfers out, or otherwise removes value from the Brokerage Account Reference Asset, or (ii) sells, transfers, replaces, or materially encumber any Reference Asset (each, a “Removal Event”), then for purposes of calculating the Separation Payout, the removed value shall be treated as though it remained invested and exposed to benchmark performance through the Separation Date, as adjusted below.  
5.5(b) Definitions.  
(i) “Withdrawal” means any cash withdrawal, in-kind distribution, transfer out, or other removal of value from the Brokerage Account Reference Asset that does not remain in that account.  
(ii) “Brokerage Contributions” means any additional deposits or contributions made by Partner A into the Brokerage Account Reference Asset after the Execution Date.  
(iii) “Transfer FMV” means the fair market value (or proceeds value) of a disposed, replaced, or encumbered Reference Asset as of the date of the Removal Event, determined in a commercially reasonable manner based on available documentation (e.g., closing statement, payoff statement, executed sale agreement, lender documentation, custodian statements, or other reliable records). In the case of an encumbrance or refinancing, Transfer FMV (or the Removed Amount below) shall be measured to the extent the transaction is economically equivalent to removal of value (e.g., cash-out proceeds retained by Partner A).  
(iv) “Removed Amount” means:  
(A) for the Brokerage Account Reference Asset: each Withdrawal amount; and  
(B) for any other Reference Asset: the Transfer FMV (or the portion of Transfer FMV) that is economically equivalent to removal of value.  
5.5(c) Deemed Value at Separation (the add-back). Each Removed Amount will be added back for payout calculation purposes at its “Deemed Value at Separation,” calculated as:  
Deemed Value at Separation = Removed Amount × G  
where G is the “Deemed Growth Factor” in Section 5.5(d), subject to the cap in Section 5.5(e).  
5.5(d) Deemed Growth Factor (double upside; single downside). Let the benchmark return from the Removal Event date to the Separation Date be:  
r = (Index_Sep ÷ Index_Event) − 1  
Then the Deemed Growth Factor G is:  
(i) If r > 0: G = 1 + 2r (double the upside)  
(ii) If r ≤ 0: G = 1 + r (normal downside only)  
5.5(e) Cap (to keep it reasonable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, G shall not exceed 1.75 (the “Cap”). Therefore, Deemed Value at Separation can never exceed 1.75× the Removed Amount.  
5.5(f) Benchmarks; index timing.  
(i) Brokerage / securities benchmark: S&P 500 Total Return Index (ticker: SPXT) (the “Equity Benchmark”).  
(ii) Real estate benchmark: the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index for the metropolitan area where the Residence is located; if unavailable, the FHFA House Price Index (All-Transactions) for the applicable MSA; if unavailable, the FHFA HPI for the state/region; if unavailable, the FHFA U.S. National series (the “Real Estate Benchmark”).  
(iii) Index levels:  
(A) For SPXT: use the official level for the trading day corresponding to the Removal Event date and the Separation Date (or the most recent prior trading day if the date is not a trading day).  
(B) For Real Estate Benchmark series (which publish with a lag): “Index_Event” and “Index_Sep” mean the most recently published index value available for the period immediately preceding the relevant date, applied consistently.  
5.5(g) Brokerage Adjusted Final Value (simple netting for contributions). To avoid counting additional deposits as “appreciation,” the Brokerage Account “Adjusted Final Value” used in Article V shall be:  
Brokerage Adjusted Final Value = Brokerage Final Value − Brokerage Contributions + Σ(Deemed Value at Separation for each Withdrawal)  
where Brokerage Final Value is the Brokerage Account value at market close on the Separation Date (as evidenced by custodian statements).  
5.5(h) Simple Safe Harbor (optional but practical). If within ninety (90) days after a Removal Event, Partner A reinvests an amount equal to the Removed Amount into (i) the same Reference Asset, or (ii) a replacement asset of the same general type (brokerage for brokerage; real estate for real estate), and provides reasonable documentation, then the arbitrator may treat that Removal Event as cured and apply single benchmark performance only (i.e., G = 1 + r even if r > 0).  
5.5(i) Notice; documentation. Partner A shall provide written notice to Partner B of any Removal Event exceeding $[________] within five (5) business days after it occurs (or as soon as practicable in emergencies), including the date, amount, and reasonable supporting documentation sufficient to apply this Section 5.5.  
5.5(j) Construction (valuation convention; not punitive damages). This Section 5.5 is a valuation convention intended to approximate the Reference Assets’ counterfactual value at separation and deter opportunistic manipulation, not to impose punitive damages.

### 5.6 Payment Form & Funding Source
Partner A shall satisfy any Separation Payout payable under this Agreement solely in cash (U.S. dollars) by wire transfer or ACH within ninety (90) days of the applicable vesting event. No in-kind transfer is permitted. Partner A retains sole discretion on how to source funds (reserves, borrowing, liquidation); nothing herein requires the sale of any particular asset. Actual, out-of-pocket transaction costs incurred to produce liquidity (“Actual Liquidity Costs”) shall be deducted from Net Appreciation. If paid from cash reserves, Liquidity Costs are $0.

---

## ARTICLE VI — PROTECTIVE COVENANTS

### 6.1 Prevention of Waste
If either Party demonstrates intentional devaluation of the Real Estate through willful refusal to perform necessary maintenance that a reasonable homeowner would undertake, the reasonable remediation cost (supported by two independent bids) shall be added back to the Real Estate Final FMV (or other applicable valuation) for payout calculation purposes.

### 6.2 Permitted Distributions & Encumbrances
Partner A may take distributions from the Brokerage Account at discretion; however, any Withdrawals, sales, transfers, substitutions, refinancings, or other Removal Events are treated pursuant to the deemed add-back and benchmark adjustment mechanics set forth in Section 5.5 and shall not reduce the Separation Payout calculation. Partner A shall not place new liens on the Real Estate during the term without providing written notice to Partner B within ten (10) business days. Refinancing proceeds retained by Partner A shall not reduce the payout calculation.

### 6.3 Investment Discretion
Partner A retains sole discretion regarding investment allocation and risk profile. Partner B does not act as an investment adviser or fiduciary.

### 6.4 Waiver of Partition
Partner B expressly, irrevocably, and permanently waives any and all rights to seek partition of the Real Estate Asset, force a judicial sale, or file a lis pendens.

---

## ARTICLE VII — TERMINATION, VESTING, CAUSE, AND SEVERANCE

### 7.1 Standard Vesting (Sunset Date)
Subject to Section 7.4(a) (Voluntary Resignation), Section 7.4(d) (Good Reason), and subject to Section 7.4(b) (Termination for Cause), the Separation Payout vests one hundred percent (100%) if the Parties maintain Continuous Cohabitation through the third (3rd) anniversary of the Execution Date (the “Sunset Date”).

### 7.2 Involuntary Termination Without Cause (Pro-Rata Vesting)
If Partner A terminates the relationship and asks Partner B to vacate prior to the Sunset Date, and such termination is not for Cause, Partner B shall immediately vest in a pro-rata portion:  
**(Days Cohabitated / Term Days) × Total Accrued Payout**  
where:  
(a) “Days Cohabitated” means the number of calendar days from the Execution Date through the Separation Date;  
(b) “Term Days” means the number of calendar days from the Execution Date through the Sunset Date; and  
(c) “Total Accrued Payout” means the Separation Payout calculated under Article V as of the Separation Date before application of any vesting percentage and before any offset/credit under Section 7.3(b).

### 7.3 Separate Occupancy & Relocation Severance (No Double Recovery)
Termination of this Agreement triggers termination of Partner B’s status as a licensee in the Residence.  
(a) **Relocation Severance Amount.** Subject to subsection (b), Partner A shall pay Partner B a one-time relocation severance of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) (the “Relocation Severance”), payable within fourteen (14) days after Partner B: (i) vacates the Residence, (ii) returns all keys/access credentials, and (iii) returns or destroys Confidential Information in accordance with Section 9.4.  
(b) **No Double Recovery.** If any Separation Payout is payable, the Relocation Severance (if paid) shall be treated as an advance and credited dollar-for-dollar against the Separation Payout otherwise due.  
(c) **No Severance for Cause; Repayment/Offset.** If termination occurs for Cause, no Relocation Severance is due. If Relocation Severance was paid and a final arbitration award determines termination was for Cause, Partner B shall repay the Relocation Severance within thirty (30) days; provided that Partner A may, at Partner A’s election, treat such repayment amount as an Allowed Offset under Section 7.4(b) and credit it against any Separation Payout otherwise payable (subject to the Floor Amount).  
(d) **Transitional Assistance Only.** The Relocation Severance is intended solely as transitional assistance and shall not be construed as consideration for Meretricious Services.

### 7.4 Voluntary Resignation; Termination for Cause; Remedies; Good Reason (Partner A Misconduct)
(a) **Voluntary Resignation (0.5 × Pro-Rata Vesting; Good Reason Carve-Out).** Notwithstanding Sections 7.1 and 7.2, if Partner B voluntarily ends the relationship and/or terminates cohabitation for any reason other than termination by Partner A for Cause, Partner B shall be entitled to a reduced vested portion of the Separation Payout equal to:  
**0.50 × (Days Cohabitated / Term Days) × Total Accrued Payout**  
For avoidance of doubt, the maximum vested portion payable under this Section 7.4(a) is fifty percent (50%) of the Total Accrued Payout. Partner B may be eligible for Relocation Severance only as provided in Section 7.3, and any Relocation Severance paid shall be credited dollar-for-dollar against amounts otherwise due pursuant to Section 7.3(b).  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Partner B terminates cohabitation due to a Partner A Misconduct Event (as defined in Section 7.4(d)), then the 0.50 multiplier shall not apply and Partner B’s vesting shall be determined under Section 7.4(d).  

(b) **Termination for Cause (Unvested Forfeiture; Vested Floor; Offsets).** If the Agreement or cohabitation is terminated for Cause, then:  
(i) **Unvested Forfeiture.** Partner B forfeits one hundred percent (100%) of any unvested portion of the Separation Payout.  
(ii) **Vested Amount Payable Subject to Offsets.** Any vested portion of the Separation Payout (if any) remains payable, reduced only by the Allowed Offsets in subsection (iv), and subject to the Floor Amount in subsection (iii).  
(iii) **Floor Amount (50% of Vested).** Notwithstanding subsection (ii), in no event shall the net Separation Payout payable to Partner B be reduced below an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the vested Separation Payout that would otherwise be payable to Partner B absent Cause (the “Floor Amount”).  
(iv) **Allowed Offsets (Objective, Proven Amounts Only).** “Allowed Offsets” means only the following amounts, to the extent finally determined by written admission, final arbitration award, or final, non-appealable conviction record (as applicable), and only to the extent actually incurred or actually paid by Partner A:  
(A) **Operating Account Misuse:** undisputed or finally determined misappropriation of Operating Account funds (net of authorized expenditures and net of any repayments);  
(B) **Residence Damage:** documented repair/remediation costs for intentional or reckless material physical damage to the Residence (supported by insurer/adjuster findings or licensed contractor documentation); and  
(C) **Confidentiality Breach Damages:** actual, out-of-pocket losses and/or damages (and, if awarded, attorneys’ fees and costs) specifically awarded by the arbitrator for a proven, material breach of Article IX (excluding any Protected Disclosure under Section 9.3).  
(v) **Net Payable Formula.** The net Separation Payout payable (if any) after a Cause determination shall be calculated as:  
**Net Payable = max(Floor Amount, Vested Payout − Allowed Offsets)**  
(vi) **Protected Disclosures Preserved.** No Allowed Offset, damages award, or fee award shall be imposed in a manner that penalizes any Protected Disclosure under Section 9.3 or violates non-waivable law (including the Speak Out Act).  

(c) **Cause (Defined).** “Cause” is strictly limited to:  
(i) Uncured Holding Out under Section 1.5;  
(ii) A final, non-appealable felony conviction involving financial fraud, theft, violence, or credible threats of violence against the other Party;  
(iii) Intentional misappropriation of Operating Account funds exceeding **$[Amount]** (net of documented authorized expenditures);  
(iv) Intentional or reckless material physical damage to the Residence exceeding **$[Amount]**, supported by insurer/adjuster findings or licensed contractor documentation;  
(v) A material breach of the confidentiality duties in Article IX that remains uncured after notice and cure (to the extent curable);  
(vi) A material breach of Section 3.6(a) (No Commingling) that remains uncured after notice and cure (to the extent curable);  
(vii) Public Disparagement (narrow): a knowingly false statement of fact (or reckless disregard as to falsity) about the other Party that causes material, demonstrable harm, excluding any Protected Disclosure (as defined in Section 9.3), excluding protected disclosures and good-faith reporting, and only if uncured where cure is feasible.  

(d) **Partner A Misconduct (Good Reason); Pro-Rata Vesting Without Haircut.**  
(i) **Partner A Misconduct Event (Defined).** A “Partner A Misconduct Event” means a final, non-appealable criminal conviction of Partner A for domestic violence or a violent offense committed against Partner B, including assault, battery, strangulation, stalking, or a comparable offense under applicable law.  
(ii) **Good Reason Termination by Partner B.** If Partner B terminates cohabitation after a Partner A Misconduct Event, then Partner B’s termination shall be treated as a “Good Reason” termination for purposes of this Agreement.  
(iii) **Pro-Rata Vesting (No 0.50 Haircut).** Upon a Good Reason termination under this Section 7.4(d), Partner B shall vest in the Separation Payout on the same basis as an Involuntary Termination Without Cause under Section 7.2, except that this Section 7.4(d) applies (and the 0.50 multiplier in Section 7.4(a) does not). Accordingly, Partner B’s vested portion shall equal:  
**(Days Cohabitated / Term Days) × Total Accrued Payout**  
calculated as of the Separation Date.  
(iv) **Relocation Severance Credit.** Relocation Severance, if paid, shall remain subject to the “No Double Recovery” credit in Section 7.3(b) unless the Parties expressly agree otherwise in a signed writing.  
(v) **Proof Standard.** A Partner A Misconduct Event is established only by the final, non-appealable conviction record described in Section 7.4(d)(i).

### 7.5 Cause Process: Notice, Cure, and Determination
(a) **Written Notice of Default.** Except for immediate-risk events, the Party asserting Cause must provide written notice describing the alleged Cause in reasonable detail (“Notice of Default”).  
(b) **Cure Periods (Where Curable):**  
- Holding Out: ten (10) days (per Section 1.5).  
- Confidentiality: fifteen (15) days.  
- Non-Commingling: fifteen (15) days.  
- Public Disparagement: ten (10) days.  
- Property Damage: if curable, fifteen (15) days to cooperate in remediation.  
(Events not reasonably curable have no cure period.)  
(c) **Cause Determination Standard.** Cause is established only by written admission, final arbitration award, or final, non-appealable conviction record (as applicable). No reduction, forfeiture, or offset under Section 7.4(b) applies unless and until Cause is established under this subsection.  
(d) **No Technical Traps.** A good-faith, non-material breach that is timely cured shall not constitute Cause.  
(e) **Interim Payment / Holdback Pending Cause Decision.** If Partner A asserts Cause in good faith, Partner A may temporarily hold back payment of the disputed portion of the Separation Payout pending expedited arbitration determination of Cause, but Partner A shall timely pay any undisputed portion. The arbitrator may order appropriate interim measures to prevent prejudice or delay.

### 7.6 Continuous Cohabitation; Permitted Absences; Temporary Separate Occupancy
(a) Continuous Cohabitation means both Parties maintain the Residence as their primary residence up to the Separation Date.  
(b) Temporary absences for travel/work/family/medical/safety planning do not interrupt Continuous Cohabitation if the absent Party retains meaningful belongings and intends to return (ninety (90) consecutive days / one hundred eighty (180) cumulative days in a rolling twelve (12) months presumptively temporary).  
(c) Temporary move-out of thirty (30) days or less does not interrupt Continuous Cohabitation unless accompanied by Notice of Termination or clear evidence of establishing a new primary residence.  
(d) Separate bedrooms do not, by themselves, terminate cohabitation or set the Separation Date.  
(e) Continuous Cohabitation ends when a Party establishes a new primary residence with intent not to return, evidenced by objective facts, subject to Section 5.4(c).

### 7.7 Fixed Term; Automatic Expiration; Renewal; Effect
(a) **Fixed Term.** This Agreement shall commence on the Execution Date and shall automatically expire at 11:59 PM local time on the Sunset Date, unless renewed in a signed writing by both Parties as provided in this Section 7.7.  
(b) **No Implied Renewal; No Renewal by Conduct.** The Parties agree there shall be no implied renewal, extension, or modification of this Agreement by conduct, continued cohabitation, partial performance, or course of dealing. Any renewal or extension must be in a written instrument signed by both Parties that expressly states it renews or extends this Agreement (a “Renewal Agreement”).  
(c) **Effect of Expiration (No New Accrual; Freeze of Economic Metrics).** If this Agreement expires on the Sunset Date and is not renewed:  
(i) Monthly Support Ends. Partner A’s obligation to make the Monthly Support Payment under Article IV shall end as of the Sunset Date (no Monthly Support Payment shall be due for any period after the Sunset Date unless the Parties execute a Renewal Agreement).  
(ii) No Further Accrual After Sunset. No amounts shall accrue after the Sunset Date under Article V, and no post-Sunset cohabitation shall increase any Base Accrual Component, Appreciation Component, or any other payout metric.  
(iii) Valuation and Calculation Freeze. For purposes of Article V and Article VII only, if the Parties continue cohabing after the Sunset Date without a Renewal Agreement, then all valuations, benchmark/index levels, and other inputs to the Separation Payout shall be deemed measured as of the Sunset Date, and the Separation Payout (if later triggered) shall be calculated as if the Separation Date were the Sunset Date.  
(iv) No Requirement to Separate. Expiration of this Agreement does not require either Party to end cohabitation; it only means that, absent a Renewal Agreement, the Parties’ relationship after the Sunset Date is outside the scope of this Agreement except as provided in Section 7.7(d).  
(d) **Survival.** Notwithstanding expiration, Articles I, VI, IX (including Section 9.5 to the extent triggered by payment), X, XI, and any accrued payment obligations shall survive.  
(e) **Renewal Terms; New Baselines (Optional).** Any Renewal Agreement may, by express written terms, reset baseline values, reference assets, payout mechanics, or other provisions.

## ARTICLE VIII — DEATH OR INCAPACITY OF PARTNER A

### 8.1 Death
Partner A’s death constitutes an Involuntary Termination Without Cause under Section 7.2. The Successor Trustee shall pay the accrued pro-rata Separation Payout within ninety (90) days, establishing Partner B as a creditor of the Trust.

### 8.2 Incapacity
If Partner A is incapacitated, the Successor Trustee or Partner A’s Power of Attorney shall assume Partner A’s obligations herein.

---

## ARTICLE IX — CONFIDENTIALITY & NON-DISCLOSURE (NDA)

### 9.1 Confidential Information
Includes all non-public information relating to Partner A, the Trust, the Residence, and dependents (financial records, passwords, medical/educational records, security arrangements, personal communications), including Exhibit C.

### 9.2 Duty & Term
Partner B shall hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence for ten (10) years following termination (trade secrets protected indefinitely).

### 9.3 Permitted Disclosures / Carve-Outs; Protected Disclosures
Notwithstanding Sections 9.1–9.2, Partner B may disclose Confidential Information only as follows (each, a “Protected Disclosure”):  
(a) Professional Advisers. To Partner B’s attorneys, accountants, tax advisers, financial advisers, or therapists, provided such persons are informed the information is confidential and are bound by professional duties of confidentiality (or agree in writing to maintain confidentiality).  
(b) Legal Compulsion / Process. When legally compelled by subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process, provided Partner B (to the extent legally permitted) gives Partner A prompt written notice and reasonably cooperates with efforts to seek confidential treatment (e.g., protective order) or narrow the request.  
(c) Lawful Reporting; Safety; Governmental Inquiries. To law enforcement, regulators, or governmental agencies; for mandatory reporting; for obtaining medical care; or to prevent or address a bona fide safety risk or threatened harm.  
(d) Third-Party Vendors (Limited). To third-party vendors solely as reasonably necessary to perform household coordination under this Agreement, and only to the minimum extent reasonably necessary for such purpose.  
(e) Speak Out Act; Sexual Assault / Sexual Harassment; Non-Waivable Rights. Nothing in this Agreement (including this Article IX or any other provision that could be construed to restrict speech) shall be interpreted or applied to prohibit, restrict, or penalize Partner B from disclosing or discussing facts or allegations relating to sexual assault or sexual harassment, or from making any other disclosure, to the extent such restriction is rendered unenforceable by applicable law, including the federal Speak Out Act (or any similar federal, state, local, or tribal law), or to the extent such rights cannot be waived. Any portion of this Agreement that would be unenforceable under such law shall be deemed severed solely to that extent, and all Protected Disclosures shall remain permitted.

### 9.4 Return of Materials
Upon termination, Partner B shall return or destroy Partner A’s Confidential Information, except where required by law or ordinary-course recordkeeping.

### 9.5 Release; Covenant Not to Sue (Effective Upon Payment)
(a) Release by Partner B (Conditioned on Payment). Upon Partner A’s payment in full of all amounts then due and payable to Partner B under this Agreement (including any undisputed Monthly Support Payment arrears, any Relocation Severance due, and any Separation Payout due) (the “Settlement Payment”), Partner B irrevocably releases and forever discharges Partner A, the Trust, and their respective trustees, beneficiaries, agents, representatives, and assigns (collectively, the “Released Parties”) from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, liabilities, and damages of every kind, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that Partner B has or may have arising out of or relating to: (i) the Parties’ relationship and cohabitation; (ii) the Residence; (iii) any alleged property, support, or equitable claims; and (iv) any claims that could have been asserted based on the Parties’ living arrangement, except for claims to enforce this Agreement and the Settlement Payment.  
(b) Covenant Not to Sue. Effective upon the Settlement Payment, Partner B covenants not to file or maintain any action against any Released Party on any Released Claim.  
(c) Optional California Civil Code Section 1542 Waiver (Use if California law may apply).  
[If applicable:] Partner B acknowledges that they have been advised of and expressly waive the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release…”  
(d) No Meretricious Consideration. The Parties agree this Section 9.5 is intended as a standard settlement-style release and is independent consideration for the Settlement Payment, severable from any intimate aspect of the Parties’ relationship.  
(e) Protected Disclosures Preserved. Nothing in this Section 9.5 prohibits or restricts any Protected Disclosure under Section 9.3 or Partner B’s participation in any investigation, proceeding, or testimony as permitted by law, nor does it impose liability for any statement or disclosure to the extent such restriction is unenforceable or non-waivable under applicable law (including the Speak Out Act).

---

## ARTICLE X — DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 10.1 Arbitration; Administrator; Locale
Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its formation, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination) shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in **[__________ County], [__________]**, before a single arbitrator, except as expressly permitted in Section 10.2.

### 10.2 Limited Court Relief for Injunctions
Either Party may seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief solely to prevent imminent harm relating to confidentiality/security or Holding-Out Risk conduct, without waiving arbitration on the merits. Any such court proceeding shall be brought only in the courts specified in Article XII.

### 10.3 Arbitration Costs; Advances; Attorneys’ Fees
(a) AAA and Arbitrator Fees. To ensure arbitration is not cost-prohibitive, Partner A shall advance and pay the AAA administrative/case fees and the arbitrator’s fees and expenses, subject to reallocation by the arbitrator in the final award to the extent permitted by law and this Agreement.  
(b) Filing Fee. The initiating Party shall pay the initial AAA filing fee, unless the AAA requires a different allocation or Partner A elects to pay it.  
(c) Each Side’s Fees as Incurred. Each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and expert fees as incurred, except as provided in Section 10.4.  
(d) AAA Protocols Control if Mandatory. If the AAA applies any mandatory consumer/employment (or other) protocol or fee schedule, the Parties agree to comply, and any non-waivable AAA requirement shall control over inconsistent language here.

### 10.4 Fee Shifting
The prevailing Party shall recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, except as otherwise required by law; provided that fees and costs shall not be awarded in a manner that penalizes any Protected Disclosure under Section 9.3 or violates any non-waivable statutory fee rule.

---

## ARTICLE XI — SEVERABILITY; REFORMATION (“BLUE PENCIL”); SAVINGS & CONVERSION

### 11.1 Independent Consideration; Construction
The Parties agree that (i) the economic terms of this Agreement are supported by independent consideration as stated in Section 1.2(b) and Section 5.1, including confidentiality (Article IX), waivers (Articles I and VI), dispute-resolution commitments (Article X), and releases (Section 9.5); and (ii) any references to cohabitation duration are measurement proxies and shall not be construed as consideration for Meretricious Services. If any provision is challenged on public-policy grounds relating to nonmarital relationships, the Parties direct that the Agreement be construed to preserve enforceability based on such independent consideration to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 11.2 Severability and Reformation Directive (“Blue Pencil”)
(a) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law.  
(b) Reformation / Modification (To the Extent Permitted). To the extent a tribunal has authority under applicable law, the Parties request that the tribunal interpret, limit, or modify any invalid or unenforceable provision only as necessary to make it valid and enforceable and to best effectuate the Parties’ intent. If such modification is not permitted, the provision shall be severed to the minimum extent necessary, and the remainder of this Agreement shall be enforced as written.  
(c) Priority of Preservation. In applying severability and reformation, the tribunal is directed to preserve, to the maximum extent permitted by law, (i) the confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations (Article IX), (ii) the waiver and no-holding-out provisions (Article I and Article VI), (iii) the releases and covenants not to sue (Section 9.5), and (iv) the payment mechanics (Articles IV, V, and VII).

### 11.3 Savings & Conversion to Confidentiality, Waiver, and Settlement Agreement
(a) Trigger. If any tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is void or unenforceable on public-policy grounds relating to Meretricious Services or the Parties’ nonmarital relationship (a “Public Policy Ruling”), then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Parties agree as follows.  
(b) Automatic Conversion. This Agreement shall be deemed automatically amended and converted into a standalone Confidentiality, Waiver, and Settlement Agreement (the “Converted Agreement”) consisting of: (i) Articles I, VI, IX (including Section 9.5), X, and XI; and (ii) the payment obligations and timing set forth in Articles IV, V, and VII, which shall remain enforceable as settlement consideration for confidentiality, waivers, dispute-resolution commitments, and releases, and not for Meretricious Services.  
(c) Deletion of Offending Construction. Any language or construction determined to be unenforceable under the Public Policy Ruling shall be severed, and the remaining terms shall be enforced as modified/reformed under Section 11.2.  
(d) No Waiver of Arbitration. The Converted Agreement shall remain subject to the dispute resolution provisions of Article X.
