### 1.1 Parties; Execution Date
This Cooperative Wealth & Cohabitation Agreement (this **“Agreement”**) is made and entered into on **[Date]** (the **“Execution Date”**) by and between:

- **PARTNER A:** [Partner A Legal Name], an individual residing in [State] (**“Partner A”**).  
- **PARTNER B:** [Partner B Legal Name], an individual residing in [State] (**“Partner B”**).

Partner A and Partner B may be referred to individually as a **“Party”** and collectively as the **“Parties.”**

### 1.2 Recitals
A. The Parties are in a personal relationship and intend to reside together at **[Insert Property Address]** (the **“Residence”**).  
B. The Parties explicitly do not intend to be married, whether formally, statutorily, or by informal/common-law doctrines.  
C. The Parties desire to establish a cooperative wealth-building vehicle with deterministic unwind mechanics, a periodic liquidity mechanism so Partner B may periodically receive vested value into an account in Partner B’s own name, and a minimal joint-asset governance protocol, while protecting each Party’s separate property from equitable claims to the maximum extent permitted by law.  
D. The Parties expressly agree this Agreement is **not** for sexual services, is **not** employment compensation, and does **not** obligate either Party to remain in a relationship.

## ARTICLE II — DEFINITIONS; NON-MARITAL STATUS; SEPARATE PROPERTY; NOTICES; CONSIDERATION

### 2.1 Separate Property
All property, accounts, real estate, and business interests owned by either Party prior to the Execution Date, or acquired thereafter in that Party’s individual name (excluding the Joint Account and any Joint Assets defined below), shall remain that Party’s sole and separate property.

### 2.2 Waiver of Equitable Claims Against Separate Property (Maximum Extent Permitted)
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Partner B waives any right to claim equity, constructive trust, resulting trust, equitable lien, or ownership in Partner A’s separate property (including the Residence) based on cohabitation, household contributions, or relational longevity.

**No Reliance / No Oral Promises.** Each Party acknowledges they are not relying on oral statements about future support, ownership of the Residence, or asset division beyond this Agreement. Any promise or modification must be in a signed writing per Article X.

### 2.3 No Common-Law/Informal Marriage; No Holding Out
The Parties shall not represent themselves as spouses, file tax returns as married, or hold themselves out as married to third parties. The Parties will use reasonable efforts to follow Addendum A (Holding-Out Avoidance & Non-Commingling Practices).

### 2.4 Definitions
For purposes of this Agreement:

(a) **“Continuous Cohabitation”** means the Parties maintain the Residence as their primary shared home with the intent to reside together as a household. Temporary absences for travel, work, family, or medical reasons do not interrupt Continuous Cohabitation so long as neither Party has delivered a Notice of Separation and the Parties maintain intent to continue cohabiting.

(b) **“Joint Account”** means the restricted investment account governed by Article III and controlled by the Escrow Agent/Trustee pursuant to Exhibit 1.

(c) **“Escrow Agent/Trustee”** means the neutral third party who holds control authority over the Joint Account under Exhibit 1 (whether as trustee, escrow agent, attorney-in-fact/LPOA holder, or other custodian-permitted capacity).

(d) **“Operative Date”** means the date the Agreement becomes operative under Section 3.2.

(e) **“Notice of Separation”** means a written notice stating that a Party terminates cohabitation and this Agreement, delivered in accordance with Section 2.5.

(f) **“Separation Date”** means the date and time a Notice of Separation becomes effective under Section 2.5 (or a Deemed Separation Event under Section 7.1A).

(g) **“Vested Percentage”** means Partner B’s accrued percentage under Article IV as of a given measurement time, subject to the cap.

(h) **“Valuation Time”** means the official closing value (or, for mutual funds, the published NAV) on the most recent trading day ending prior to the triggering event requiring a calculation under this Agreement, as reflected on the custodian’s official records.

(i) **“B Distribution Ledger”** means the running dollar ledger maintained by the Escrow Agent/Trustee reflecting cumulative **B Distributions** (defined below) made to or for the benefit of Partner B from the Joint Account under this Agreement, valued at the applicable Valuation Time for each entry.

(j) **“B Distribution”** means any transfer of value from the Joint Account to or for the primary benefit of Partner B, including: (i) cash distributions; (ii) in-kind securities distributions to a B account; (iii) payment from the Joint Account of Partner B’s personal expenses; and (iv) any other transfer designated in writing by both Parties as a B Distribution. **Shared spending** that is mutually agreed and reasonably for joint benefit is not a B Distribution unless expressly designated as such.

(k) **“Joint Asset”** means any tangible asset acquired in whole or in part using Joint Account funds and titled to the Parties as tenants in common (or equivalent), governed by Exhibit 2.

(l) **“Custodian Constraints”** means broker/custodian/trust-company rules, forms, operational limitations, regulatory requirements, settlement cycles, or legal restrictions that affect account control, freezing, liquidation, and/or distribution mechanics.

### 2.5 Notices; Effective Time (Anti-Gamesmanship)
Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered to the recipient by:

(i) email to the last email address designated by each Party in writing, **and**  
(ii) either nationally recognized overnight courier, certified mail, or personal delivery to the last known address.

(B) courier/certified delivery confirmation, **or**  
(C) refusal of delivery.

### 2.6 Consideration; No Meretricious Consideration
The Parties agree that the consideration for this Agreement consists of the mutual promises and legal/economic arrangements set forth herein, including without limitation: (i) Partner A’s funding and governance commitments regarding the Joint Account; (ii) Partner B’s waivers/releases and governance commitments; (iii) the Parties’ mutual covenants regarding notices, administration, dispute resolution, and cooperation; and (iv) any other mutual obligations expressly stated in this Agreement. **No part of this Agreement is consideration for sexual relations, romantic companionship, or personal intimacy**, and neither Party has any duty to provide such things.

---

## ARTICLE III — THE RESTRICTED WEALTH VEHICLE (JOINT ACCOUNT)

### 3.1 Joint Account; Required Control Structure
Within thirty (30) days of the Execution Date, the Parties shall attempt to establish the Joint Account at a major U.S. brokerage, bank, or trust company acceptable to both Parties.

The Joint Account must be opened only in a structure that, to the extent permitted by Custodian Constraints:  
(i) prevents unilateral withdrawals by either Party during Continuous Cohabitation; and  
(ii) enables a neutral third party to execute (A) the deterministic unwind upon separation (Article VII) and (B) scheduled Liquidity Events (Section 7.4), without requiring further consent from either Party once the trigger conditions are met.

### 3.2 Condition Precedent; Not Operative; No Reliance Until Implemented
This Agreement shall **not** become operative (and Partner A shall have **no** obligation to fund the Joint Account) unless and until:

(i) the Joint Account is opened in compliance with Section 3.1 (as reasonably implemented given Custodian Constraints); and  
(ii) the Escrow Agent/Trustee has executed and accepted written instructions substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 1.

**If the Agreement never becomes operative**, neither Party shall have any claim for reliance, expectation damages, or equitable relief based solely on the intention to create the Joint Account or fund it.

### 3.3 Monthly Wealth Contributions
Commencing on **[Start Date]** (or the first full month after the Operative Date), Partner A shall deposit **$[Monthly Deposit Amount]** into the Joint Account on the first business day of each calendar month during Continuous Cohabitation, unless the Parties agree otherwise in a signed writing.

### 3.4 Investment Mandate; Default Portfolio
Funds in the Joint Account shall be invested in mutually agreed-upon broad-market index funds. If the Parties do not agree on changes, the Joint Account remains invested in its then-current holdings, and new contributions shall be invested in **[Default Fund/Ticker]** (or a substantially similar successor as the Escrow Agent/Trustee reasonably determines if the default becomes unavailable).

### 3.5 Withdrawal Controls During Cohabitation (Anti-Smash-and-Grab)
During Continuous Cohabitation, neither Party may unilaterally withdraw or transfer assets from the Joint Account. Withdrawals, transfers, and liquidations may be made only upon joint written instruction of both Parties delivered to the Escrow Agent/Trustee, except for:

(i) ordinary administrative actions required by the custodian (fees, settlement, mandatory withholding required by law), and  
(ii) actions necessary to implement: (A) the deterministic unwind upon separation (Article VII) and (B) Liquidity Event distributions (Section 7.4) after a valid Liquidity Election.

---

## ARTICLE IV — MONTHLY VESTING SCHEDULE

### 4.1 Graded Monthly Vesting
Partner B’s Vested Percentage of the Joint Account shall accrue smoothly and incrementally on a monthly basis, subject to the cap in Section 4.3.

### 4.2 Accrual Rate; Clean Start Rule
Partner B shall vest at a rate of **[1.00]% per full calendar month** of Continuous Cohabitation, commencing on the **one-month anniversary of the Operative Date**.

### 4.3 Vesting Cap
This monthly accrual shall continue until Partner B’s Vested Percentage reaches a maximum cap of **[50.00]%**. Once the cap is reached, no further vesting occurs.

### 4.4 Measurement Rule
Vesting and entitlements are calculated using the Joint Account’s value at the applicable Valuation Time when a calculation is required (including a Liquidity Event, a mutually agreed withdrawal, a Joint Asset purchase, or the Separation Date).

### 4.5 B Distribution Ledger; Anti-Double-Counting
The Escrow Agent/Trustee shall maintain the B Distribution Ledger. Any B Distributions under this Agreement shall be recorded at the applicable Valuation Time. The B Distribution Ledger shall be used to ensure Partner B does not receive more than Partner B’s formulaic entitlement at Liquidity Events and at final separation.

### 4.6 No Clawback; No Negative Entitlement
Under no circumstances shall Partner B owe money back to Partner A or to the Joint Account due to subsequent market declines, valuation changes, or the timing of Liquidity distributions. All entitlement calculations use the **max(0, …)** structure stated in this Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE V — JOINT ACCOUNT USE; PRO-RATA RULE; JOINT ASSETS

### 5.1 Mutually Agreed Withdrawals (Shared Life Goals)
The Parties may jointly agree to withdraw funds from the Joint Account for shared life goals (e.g., major shared travel, joint investments, major emergencies) by joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent/Trustee (a **“Shared Withdrawal”**).

### 5.2 Pro-Rata Deduction (Ledger Rule)
Each Shared Withdrawal reduces each Party’s economic interest in the Joint Account proportionally based on the Vested Percentage at the applicable Valuation Time.

If any portion of a Shared Withdrawal is designated as a **B Distribution** (Section 2.4(j)), it shall be recorded in the B Distribution Ledger.

### 5.3 Joint Asset Purchases; Title and Governance
If Joint Account funds are used to purchase a Joint Asset, that Joint Asset shall be titled as Tenants in Common (or closest equivalent available) with ownership percentages matching the Vested Percentage at the applicable Valuation Time, unless the Parties agree otherwise in a signed writing. Governance, carrying costs, buyout rights, and sale procedures are governed by Exhibit 2.

---

## ARTICLE VI — GOOD LEAVER / BAD LEAVER (NARROW; HIGH-EVIDENCE; CLEAR DECIDER)

### 6.1 Bad Leaver (Forfeiture of Unvested Only)
Partner B shall be deemed a Bad Leaver only upon either:

(i) a final, non-appealable criminal conviction for a felony committed against Partner A, **or**  
(ii) a final arbitration award (Article VIII) finding by **clear and convincing evidence** that Partner B committed embezzlement, fraud, or intentional misappropriation from the Joint Account.

**Result:** Partner B forfeits all **unvested** amounts. Any documented misappropriation may be reimbursed from Partner B’s distribution to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 6.2 Good Leaver (Acceleration)
Partner B shall be deemed a Good Leaver only upon either:

(i) a final, non-appealable criminal conviction of Partner A for domestic violence or a violent offense committed against Partner B, **or**  
(ii) a final arbitration award finding by **clear and convincing evidence** that Partner A committed domestic violence or a violent offense against Partner B.

**Result:** Partner B’s vesting accelerates by **twelve (12) months** (e.g., +12.00%), up to the cap, and distributions shall be calculated using the accelerated Vested Percentage.

### 6.3 Standard No-Fault
In all other separations (including infidelity, general disagreements, or “growing apart”), neither acceleration nor forfeiture applies.

### 6.4 Escrow Agent/Trustee Role in Leaver Determinations
The Escrow Agent/Trustee shall not adjudicate fault. The Escrow Agent/Trustee may apply Sections 6.1–6.2 only upon receipt of a facially valid final conviction judgment or final arbitration award.

---

## ARTICLE VII — SEPARATION; DEEMED SEPARATION EVENTS; LIQUIDITY EVENTS; DETERMINISTIC UNWIND

### 7.1 Triggering Separation by Notice
Either Party may terminate this Agreement and cohabitation at any time by delivering a Notice of Separation to the other Party and to the Escrow Agent/Trustee.

### 7.1A Deemed Separation Events (Objective Triggers)
Each of the following is a **Deemed Separation Event** and shall be treated as a Separation Date at the time it occurs:

(a) death of either Party;  
(b) a final court order excluding one Party from the Residence (e.g., protective order), to the extent the Parties cease cohabiting;  
(c) written notice by both Parties that they have separated (email sufficient).

**Effect:** The deterministic unwind procedures apply as if a Notice of Separation was delivered.

### 7.2 Deterministic Unwind Upon Separation (Mandatory Freeze and Distribution)
Upon the Separation Date, the Escrow Agent/Trustee is irrevocably instructed to:

(i) freeze the Joint Account as promptly as administratively possible (subject to Custodian Constraints),  
(ii) determine the Joint Account’s value as of the Valuation Time, and  
(iii) distribute the Joint Account within thirty (30) days (or as soon as reasonably practicable if delayed by settlement cycles, Custodian Constraints, or processing) as follows:

**(a) Partner B’s Share (Net of Prior Distributions):**  
**max(0, (Joint Account value at Valuation Time × Partner B’s Vested Percentage as of the Separation Date, adjusted only if applicable under Article VI) − (B Distribution Ledger balance as of the Separation Date)).**

**(b) Partner A’s Share:** the remaining balance after payment of Partner B’s Share.

**Death Handling:** If a Party is deceased, that Party’s share shall be distributed to that Party’s estate, trust, or designated legal recipient as directed by valid legal documentation provided to the Escrow Agent/Trustee.

**Form of Distribution:** Distributions shall be made in cash unless (i) both Parties (or their legal representatives, if applicable) jointly instruct otherwise in writing, (ii) in-kind is required by Custodian Constraints, or (iii) in-kind is practicable and requested for Partner B’s Share.

### 7.3 Residence Move-Out; Transition
If the Residence is solely owned or leased by Partner A, Partner B shall have a guaranteed sixty (60) days from the Separation Date to peacefully vacate the Residence without paying rent, provided Partner B complies with reasonable safety, non-harassment, and property-care rules. Nothing herein waives non-waivable protective-order rights under applicable law.

### 7.4 Scheduled Liquidity Event (Every Three Years)

#### 7.4.1 Liquidity Event Dates; Liquidity Window
Beginning on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Operative Date and on each three (3) year anniversary thereafter (each a **“Liquidity Event Date”**), Partner B shall have a one-time election window of thirty (30) days (the **“Liquidity Window”**) to request a distribution of Partner B’s then-earned vested value under this Section 7.4, without terminating cohabitation.

#### 7.4.2 Liquidity Election
Partner B may deliver a written election during the Liquidity Window (a **“Liquidity Election”**) to the Escrow Agent/Trustee specifying:

(i) Partner B’s designated receiving brokerage account (the **“B Designated Account”**) for any in-kind distribution, and  
(ii) any reasonable operational preferences permitted by Custodian Constraints (e.g., “pro rata across positions; cash-in-lieu for fractional shares”).

#### 7.4.3 Liquidity Valuation
For Liquidity Events, Valuation Time is measured as of the most recent trading day ending prior to the Liquidity Event Date.

#### 7.4.4 Liquidity Settlement Amount (Net of Prior Distributions)
Upon a timely Liquidity Election, the Escrow Agent/Trustee shall calculate:

**Liquidity Settlement Amount = max(0, (Joint Account value at Liquidity Valuation Time × Partner B’s Vested Percentage as of the Liquidity Event Date) − (B Distribution Ledger balance as of the Liquidity Event Date)).**

#### 7.4.5 Mandatory Processing Upon Election
Upon a timely Liquidity Election, the Escrow Agent/Trustee shall distribute the Liquidity Settlement Amount within thirty (30) days (or as soon as reasonably practicable if delayed by settlement cycles or Custodian Constraints), **without requiring further consent from Partner A**.

#### 7.4.6 Form of Liquidity Distribution (Own-the-Asset Default; Custodian Constraints Control)
(a) **Default In-Kind (If Practicable).** Unless impracticable due to Custodian Constraints, the Liquidity Settlement Amount shall be distributed in kind (securities) to the B Designated Account.  
(b) **Cash Fallback.** If in-kind distribution is not practicable, the Escrow Agent/Trustee may liquidate the minimum amount necessary and distribute cash.  
(c) **Pro-Rata / Reasonable Equalization.** In-kind distributions should be pro rata across holdings to the extent reasonably practicable, with reasonable rounding or cash-in-lieu for fractional shares.

#### 7.4.7 Ledger Update; No Double Counting
The Escrow Agent/Trustee shall increase the B Distribution Ledger by the Liquidity Settlement Amount (valued at Liquidity Valuation Time) immediately upon completing the Liquidity distribution.

#### 7.4.8 No Reset of Vesting
A Liquidity distribution does not reset or slow vesting. Partner B’s Vested Percentage continues to accrue per Article IV (subject to the cap), and future Liquidity/Separation payouts are computed net of the B Distribution Ledger.

#### 7.4.9 Optionality
Partner B is not required to elect a Liquidity distribution. If Partner B does not elect within the Liquidity Window, no Liquidity distribution is made for that Liquidity Event Date, and the next Liquidity Event Date occurs as scheduled.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — DISPUTE RESOLUTION (AAA; EXPEDITED; EMERGENCY RELIEF; CARVE-OUTS)

### 8.1 Escrow Holdback for Leaver Disputes
If either Party disputes Good Leaver/Bad Leaver classification, the Escrow Agent/Trustee shall distribute the undisputed amounts promptly and hold back only the disputed incremental amount in a segregated holdback account or sub-account pending resolution.

### 8.2 Binding Arbitration (AAA; Expedited)
Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Joint Account, the B Distribution Ledger, any Joint Asset purchased with Joint Account funds, or the Leaver provisions shall be resolved by expedited, binding private arbitration administered by the **American Arbitration Association (AAA)** under its applicable rules in **[County, State]**.

### 8.3 Carve-Outs (Court Allowed for Safety and Enforcement)
Notwithstanding Section 8.2, either Party may seek in court:

(a) protective orders / restraining orders and related relief;  
(b) temporary injunctive relief necessary to preserve the status quo (including enforcing a freeze or preventing dissipation) pending arbitration; and  
(c) confirmation, enforcement, or vacatur of an arbitration award.

### 8.4 Fees and Costs (Balanced)
(a) AAA filing/administrative fees and arbitrator compensation shall be advanced 50/50 unless the arbitrator determines otherwise for good cause.  
(b) Each Party bears their own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitrator finds bad faith, willful breach, or fee-shifting is required by applicable law. If awarded, fees must be reasonable.  
(c) The arbitrator may award reasonable arbitration costs (excluding attorneys’ fees unless awarded under subsection (b)) as justice requires.

### 8.5 Confidentiality of Proceedings (Light Touch)
To the maximum extent permitted by law and AAA rules, the arbitration shall be treated as confidential. This does not restrict disclosures required by law, disclosures to attorneys/tax advisors, disclosures for enforcement, or disclosures to law enforcement, regulators, medical providers, or counselors.

---

## ARTICLE IX — TAX CHARACTERIZATION; REPORTING COOPERATION (NON-ADVICE)

### 9.1 Intended Characterization
The Parties intend that Partner A’s deposits to the Joint Account are voluntary transfers made pursuant to this Agreement and are not wages, employment compensation, or payment for services. The Parties acknowledge actual tax treatment may vary based on facts and law.

### 9.2 Liquidations to Fund Cash Distributions
If liquidation is required to fund a cash distribution (Liquidity Event or Separation), any realized gains/losses and transaction costs incurred to effect the distribution shall, to the extent practicable, be allocated economically between the Parties consistent with their economic interests under this Agreement at the applicable Valuation Time, recognizing that custodians may issue tax forms based on account titling and regulations.

### 9.3 Reporting Cooperation; Nominee/Allocation Practicalities
Each Party agrees to cooperate in good faith with reasonable steps requested by tax counsel to reflect the intended economic allocation of gains/losses and distributions, including providing W-9s, account statements, and information necessary for any nominee reporting or internal true-ups, to the extent legally required or advisable.

### 9.4 No Tax Advice
Each Party acknowledges they have been advised to consult independent tax counsel regarding any reporting obligations (including potential gift reporting, nominee reporting, and realized gains allocations) arising from deposits, vesting mechanics, and distributions.

### 10.2 Amendments
Any amendment must be in a signed writing by both Parties (notarization recommended).

### 10.3 Severability; Reformation Preference
If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 10.6 Separate Household Cost Sharing (Not Part of This Agreement)

### 10.7 Exhibit Hierarchy
Exhibits and Addendum A are incorporated by reference. If there is a conflict between the main body and an Exhibit/Addendum, the main body controls unless it explicitly states otherwise.

### 10.8 Custodian Constraints Control

## EXHIBIT 2 — JOINT ASSET PROTOCOL

**Purpose.** This protocol governs Joint Assets purchased in whole or in part with Joint Account funds.

1. **Definitions**  
(a) Joint Asset means any vehicle, real estate, or other tangible asset purchased with Joint Account funds.  
(b) Ownership Percentages means the Parties’ tenants-in-common percentages set at purchase, matching the Vested Percentage at the applicable Valuation Time (unless otherwise agreed in writing).

2. **Titling**  
Each Joint Asset shall be titled as Tenants in Common (or closest equivalent). If title cannot reflect percentages, the Parties shall sign a memorandum at purchase stating Ownership Percentages.

3. **Carrying Costs; Reimbursement**  
(a) Default: carrying costs (insurance, taxes, registration, ordinary maintenance) are paid pro rata to Ownership Percentages unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
(b) Reimbursement: if one Party pays more than their pro rata share, the excess is reimbursable within 30 days after written notice with documentation, unless netted against sale proceeds.

4. **Insurance; Liability Control (Vehicles Especially)**  
(a) Vehicles must be insured at commercially reasonable levels.  
(b) The Party primarily operating/possessing the vehicle shall be responsible for tickets, violations, and at-fault deductibles, unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
(c) Both Parties shall cooperate to keep the vehicle insurable and to avoid uninsured operation.

5. **Use and Possession (Minimal; Practical Default)**  
Unless otherwise agreed in writing:  
(a) Vehicles: reasonable shared use; if conflict, schedule by agreement; failing agreement, the Party who is the registered/insured primary operator has temporary priority pending buyout/sale, subject to reasonable access for the other Party.  
(b) Non-Residence real estate: use by mutual agreement; failing agreement, proceed to buyout/sale.

6. **Separation: Buyout First; Forced Sale Second**  
Upon Separation Date:  
Step 1 — Buyout Option (30-day election). Within 30 days after Separation Date, either Party may elect to buy the other Party’s interest at FMV × selling Party’s Ownership Percentage, less documented reimbursable advances.  
FMV: Vehicles: average of two reputable valuation sources or dealer written offer. Real estate/other: one independent appraiser agreed; if no agreement within 10 days, each Party selects an appraiser and FMV is the average.  
Closing: within 60 days after FMV is determined.  
Step 2 — Forced Sale. If no buyout election is made, or buyout does not close on time, the Joint Asset shall be sold using commercially reasonable methods with reasonable price reductions if needed.  
Net Proceeds: distributed pro rata after liens, selling costs, taxes attributable to sale, and reimbursable advances.

7. **Negative Equity**  
If sold for less than outstanding liens, shortfall is borne pro rata unless the lien arose from unilateral borrowing or misconduct by one Party, in which case that Party bears the incremental shortfall.

---

## EXHIBIT 3 — DISCLOSURE & COUNSEL PROCESS

**Purpose.** Confirm each Party had a fair opportunity to request/review financial information without attaching sensitive data to this Agreement.

1. **Opportunity to Request Information**  
Each Party acknowledges they had the opportunity to request any financial information they considered necessary to evaluate this Agreement, including (if desired) ranges for income, assets, liabilities, and expected contributions.

## ADDENDUM A — OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL & COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST
**(Reasonable Efforts; Not “Cause”)**

**Purpose.** This Addendum outlines day-to-day practices intended to reduce commingling risk and misunderstandings. The Parties agree to use reasonable efforts to follow these practices. This Addendum does not create a separate termination right unless the main Agreement expressly provides it.

### A1. Holding Out Avoidance
- Avoid spousal titles (“husband,” “wife,” “spouse”) in official contexts. “Partner/boyfriend/girlfriend” is permitted.  
- Avoid checking “Married/Spouse” boxes on forms unless legally accurate.  
- File taxes consistent with legal status, not as married.

### A2. Financial Boundaries (Non-Commingling Practices)
- The Joint Account is the intended shared wealth vehicle governed by this Agreement.  
- Partner A funds the Joint Account from separate funds unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
- The Joint Account should not be used to pay Partner A’s separate Residence mortgage, property taxes, HOA fees, or home insurance unless both Parties sign a written amendment.

### A3. Improvements to Separate Property
- Major improvements to Partner A’s separate Residence should be performed by licensed third-party vendors paid by Partner A from separate funds.  
- Routine non-value-adding chores are normal cohabitation and do not create equity.

### A4. No Oral Modifications
- No verbal promise regarding asset division or support is enforceable unless set out in a written, signed amendment.

### A5. Liquidity Events Are an Allowed Exception
- Liquidity distributions under Section 7.4 are an intended exception to “no unilateral withdrawals,” and the Escrow Agent/Trustee is authorized to implement them upon a valid Liquidity Election.
