# COOPERATIVE WEALTH GOVERNANCE AGREEMENT (WEALTH-ONLY; EVENT-DRIVEN; RING-FENCED POOL)
*(Independent Administrator–Controlled Restricted LLC Brokerage Account; Deterministic Unwind; Periodic Liquidity Events; Joint Asset Protocol; Minimal Disclosure Process)*

> **TEMPLATE NOTICE: NOT LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE.**  
> This document is a conceptual template intended for educational and informational purposes only. It does not constitute legal advice or tax advice. Laws regarding property rights, LLCs, arbitration, securities custody, partnership characterization, and taxation vary heavily by jurisdiction. Each Party must consult independent legal counsel and independent tax counsel before executing this Agreement, forming any entity, or funding any account contemplated herein.

> **IMPORTANT STRUCTURE NOTE (DESIGN INTENT).**  
> This Agreement is designed as a governance wrapper for a restricted brokerage account held in a Vehicle LLC. It is drafted to:  
> (1) reduce “payment-for-performance” optics by making funding voluntary and non-enforceable;  
> (2) implement “anti-smash-and-grab” restrictions (no unilateral transfers-out);  
> (3) provide deterministic unwind mechanics and periodic Liquidity Events; and  
> (4) define the Independent Administrator role as “event-only” (Liquidity Events and termination unwind) to reduce operational burden and improve real-world fillability.  
> **THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROMISE ANY SPECIFIC TAX CHARACTERIZATION.** Tax outcomes depend on facts and law.

## ARTICLE I — PARTIES; EXECUTION DATE; PURPOSE; INTENT; SCOPE

### 1.1 Parties; Execution Date
This Cooperative Wealth Governance Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is made and entered into on **[Date]** (the “**Execution Date**”) by and between:

- **PARTY A:** [Party A Legal Name], an individual residing in [State] (“**Party A**”).  
- **PARTY B:** [Party B Legal Name], an individual residing in [State] (“**Party B**”).

Party A and Party B may be referred to individually as a “**Party**” and collectively as the “**Parties**.”

### 1.2 Purpose
The Parties desire to establish a cooperative wealth-building vehicle with:  
(i) a restricted brokerage account held by a Vehicle LLC and controlled for transfers-out and distributions by a neutral Independent Administrator;  
(ii) deterministic unwind mechanics;  
(iii) periodic Liquidity Events allowing Party B to receive value into an account in Party B’s own name; and  
(iv) a minimal joint-asset governance protocol for tangible assets purchased using Vehicle Account funds.

### 1.3 Relationship Neutrality; No Personal Obligation
Nothing in this Agreement creates an obligation for either Party to maintain any personal relationship, shared household, living arrangement, or companionship. Either Party may terminate this Agreement as provided herein.

### 1.4 No Employment; No Services; No Meretricious Consideration
The Parties intend this Agreement to be a financial governance arrangement only. It is not wages, employment compensation, or payment for services. No part of this Agreement is consideration for sexual relations, romantic companionship, or personal intimacy.

### 1.5 No Funding Obligation; No Reliance; No Arrears
Except as expressly stated in a signed amendment, neither Party is obligated to fund the Vehicle Account. Any references to target or intended contributions are non-binding. Neither Party may claim reliance damages, expectation damages, arrears, or “promised payments” based solely on the other Party’s decision to fund or not fund the Vehicle Account.

### 1.6 Scope Boundary (Not Household / Not Support)
This Agreement governs only the establishment, control, allocation mechanics, liquidity mechanics, and termination unwind of the Vehicle Account (and any Joint Assets purchased with Vehicle Account funds). This Agreement does not govern living arrangements, household budgeting, personal support, or relationship expectations, and any such matters (if addressed) are handled only in separate written instruments that are not incorporated into this Agreement unless this Agreement expressly states otherwise.

### 1.7 Mutual Consideration; Governance-Only (Non-Service)
In consideration of the mutual covenants, dispute-resolution, notice, non-recourse, and scope-limiting commitments herein, each Party agrees to be bound by this Agreement’s governance mechanics once operative, including: (a) notice and anti-evasion provisions (Article II), (b) arbitration and enforcement provisions (Article VIII), (c) non-recourse limitation (Section 4.7), (d) mutual release and scope lock (Section 1.9), and (e) reporting cooperation provisions (Article IX), to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 1.8 No Tax Characterization Promise
The Parties acknowledge that tax characterization and reporting depend on facts and law. Nothing in this Agreement is a promise, representation, or guarantee that any transfer, distribution, or allocation under this Agreement will be treated as a “gift,” “income,” “compensation,” “support,” “partnership distribution,” or any other specific characterization for tax purposes.

### 1.9 Mutual Release; Scope Lock (To the Maximum Extent Permitted by Law)
(a) **Mutual Release (Relationship-Adjacent Claims).** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Party releases and waives any claim against the other Party’s separate property arising out of or relating to the Parties’ personal relationship (if any), including any claim styled as implied contract, quasi-contract, unjust enrichment, reliance/expectation damages, or “support-like” relief, except for claims (i) expressly arising under this Agreement and payable solely from the Vehicle Account (and Joint Assets purchased with Vehicle Account funds), or (ii) arising from fraud or intentional misappropriation.

(b) **No Expansion of Remedies.** The Parties intend that remedies for disputes relating to this Agreement are limited to: (i) specific performance and injunctive relief to preserve or implement the Vehicle Account mechanics; (ii) distribution holdback and release of undisputed amounts; and (iii) in-pool true-ups/setoffs expressly permitted herein. No Party may seek damages or recovery against the other Party’s separate property for any entitlement claimed under this Agreement.

(c) **Mandatory Carveouts Preserved.** Nothing in this Section limits any non-waivable rights, including rights of third parties, or any child-related statutory rights/obligations that cannot be waived by private agreement.

### 2.2 No Partnership; No Fiduciary Duty Between Parties; Limited Purpose
(a) **No Partnership / Joint Venture.** The Parties intend that this Agreement does not create a general partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, or fiduciary relationship between the Parties.

(m) **“B Distribution”** means a transfer of value from the Vehicle Account to Party B’s B Designated Account (in cash or in-kind securities), executed by the Independent Administrator pursuant to an Administrator Event. For avoidance of doubt: (i) a Shared Withdrawal for shared goals is not a B Distribution unless expressly designated as such in a joint written instruction; and (ii) payment of Party B’s personal expenses from the Vehicle Account is not permitted unless both Parties provide a one-time joint written instruction expressly designating such payment as a B Distribution for ledger purposes.

### 2.4 Notices; Deemed Delivery; Address Updates; Fallback Channel (Anti-Evasion)
(a) **Notice Contact Information.** Each Party shall designate in writing to the other Party and to the Independent Administrator: (i) a Notice Email address (“**Notice Email**”), (ii) a physical mailing address (“**Notice Address**”), and (iii) an optional mobile number and/or messaging handle for the Fallback Channel (“**Fallback Contact**”). The Parties’ initial Notice Email, Notice Address, and Fallback Contact (if any) are set forth in Exhibit 0.

**Updates Effective Only Upon Notice.** Any update to Notice Email/Notice Address/Fallback Contact must be delivered as a notice under this Section 2.4 to the other Party and to the Independent Administrator, and becomes effective only upon deemed delivery under subsection (c).

(b) **Permitted Methods.** Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and sent to the recipient (and, where applicable, to the Independent Administrator) by:  
(i) email to the recipient’s Notice Email; and  
(ii) nationally recognized overnight courier (signature requested) or certified mail to the recipient’s Notice Address.

(c) **Deemed Effective Time (General Notices).** Except as modified for Termination Notice in subsection (g), a notice is deemed effective at the earliest of:  
(i) the time the email is sent (as shown by the sender’s email records) provided it is not rejected by an immediate “hard bounce”; or  
(ii) the second (2nd) business day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier (as shown by tracking), or the fifth (5th) business day after mailing by certified mail (as shown by mailing receipt),  
in each case, so long as the notice was sent to the recipient’s last designated Notice Email and Notice Address.

(d) **Fallback Channel (Supplemental).** If the sender receives an email hard bounce or the courier/certified mail is returned as undeliverable, and the recipient has provided a Fallback Contact, the sender shall also send a copy of the notice via the Fallback Channel, which may be SMS and/or a widely used encrypted messaging application designated in writing by the recipient. Use of the Fallback Channel is supplemental and does not delay effectiveness under this Section 2.4.

(e) **Unreachability; No Evasion.** The fact that a notice is not actually received, is returned as undeliverable, or is otherwise not acknowledged shall not prevent the notice from becoming effective if sent in compliance with this Section 2.4.

(f) **Copies to Independent Administrator.** Any Termination Notice and any Liquidity Election must also be sent to the Independent Administrator using the same methods (email plus courier/certified mail), and may also be copied via the Fallback Channel if applicable. The Independent Administrator may rely on the deemed effective time under this Section 2.4.

(g) **Termination Notice Effective Time (Tightened).** Notwithstanding subsection (c), a Termination Notice is effective only at the **later** of:  
(i) the time the Termination Notice email is sent without an immediate hard bounce; and  
(ii) the second (2nd) business day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier (signature requested), or the fifth (5th) business day after mailing by certified mail,  
in each case sent to the recipient’s last designated Notice Email and Notice Address and copied to the Independent Administrator.

### 2.5 Alternative Service for Disputes (Where Permitted)
If a dispute arises under this Agreement and a Party cannot, after reasonable efforts, be reached at the Notice Email/Notice Address/Fallback Contact on file, the arbitrator (or a court with jurisdiction) may authorize alternative means of service and notice consistent with applicable law and due process, including service by email-only, messaging-only, service on counsel, service by publication, or any other method reasonably calculated to provide notice under the circumstances. Any such order shall be sufficient authority for the Independent Administrator to act in reliance on notices, interim orders, or final awards delivered using such authorized method.

## ARTICLE III — THE RESTRICTED WEALTH VEHICLE (VEHICLE LLC + VEHICLE ACCOUNT)

### 3.1 Vehicle LLC and Vehicle Account; Required Control Structure
Within thirty (30) days of the Execution Date, Party A shall use reasonable efforts to form the Vehicle LLC and the Parties shall attempt to establish the Vehicle Account at a major U.S. brokerage, bank, or trust company acceptable to both Parties. Failure to implement within 30 days is not a breach if caused by Custodian Constraints, Independent Administrator availability, or practical implementation delays.

The Vehicle Account must be opened only in a structure that, to the extent permitted by Custodian Constraints:  
(i) prevents unilateral withdrawals/transfers-out by either Party during the Term; and  
(ii) enables the Independent Administrator to execute Administrator Events without requiring further consent from either Party once the trigger conditions are met; and  
(iii) limits Party A’s access to Trading Authority only (no transfers-out, no distributions, no pledges, no borrowing).

### 3.1A Vehicle LLC Anti-Bypass Covenant (Implementation Integrity)
During the Term, Party A shall not, without Party B’s prior written consent and the Independent Administrator’s written consent:  
(a) dissolve, merge, recapitalize, or transfer ownership of the Vehicle LLC;  
(b) cause the Vehicle LLC to open additional brokerage accounts intended to bypass this Agreement;  
(c) cause the Vehicle LLC to pledge, encumber, borrow against, or grant a security interest in Vehicle Account assets; or  
(d) amend the Vehicle LLC’s governing documents in a manner that materially impairs Party B’s distribution rights under this Agreement or the Independent Administrator’s control as described in Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 4.

### 3.1B Bypass Event; Protective Freeze; Optional Deemed Termination
(a) **Bypass Event.** A “Bypass Event” occurs if Party A violates Section 3.1A or materially interferes with the Independent Administrator’s control authority described in Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 4.  
(b) **Protective Freeze Request.** Upon written notice from Party B alleging a Bypass Event with reasonable specificity, the Independent Administrator is authorized to implement a protective freeze on transfers-out (not trading) as promptly as practicable, subject to Custodian Constraints, pending resolution under Article VIII.  
(c) **Optional Deemed Termination (Election).** If a final arbitration award determines a Bypass Event occurred, Party B may elect (by written notice to Party A and the Independent Administrator) to treat the award date as a Deemed Termination Event, in which case the Independent Administrator shall proceed with the deterministic unwind under Section 7.2.

### 3.2 Condition Precedent; Agreement Not Operative Until Implemented
This Agreement shall not become operative unless and until:  
(i) the Vehicle Account is opened in compliance with Section 3.1 (as reasonably implemented given Custodian Constraints); and  
(ii) the Independent Administrator has executed and accepted written instructions substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 1; and  
(iii) the Vehicle LLC’s operating agreement and/or a custodian-accepted control instrument (as applicable) vests the Independent Administrator with exclusive authority for transfers-out/distributions and freeze/unwind actions, and limits Party A’s authority to Trading Authority only, in each case in a form reasonably acceptable to the Independent Administrator and consistent with Exhibit 4; and  
(iv) the custodian account permissions reflect the above authority split (Trading Authority vs transfers-out/distributions) to the satisfaction of the Independent Administrator.

If the Agreement never becomes operative, neither Party shall have any claim for reliance, expectation damages, or equitable relief based solely on the intention to create the Vehicle Account or fund it.

### 3.3 Voluntary Funding; Target Contributions (Non-Binding)
Any contributions to the Vehicle Account are voluntary. As a non-binding target only, Party A may contribute up to **$[Monthly Deposit Amount]** per month commencing on **[Start Date]**, but Party A may reduce, pause, or stop contributions at any time without breach.  
**No Arrears.** No Party shall owe arrears, back-payments, or damages for failing to make any target contribution.

### 3.4 Investment Mandate; Party A Trading Authority; Guardrails; In-Pool Remedies
(a) **Investment Objective.** Vehicle Account funds shall be invested primarily in broad-market index funds/ETFs.  
(b) **Party A Trading Authority.** Party A may direct trades within the Vehicle Account as Trading Authority only, subject to this Section 3.4 and Custodian Constraints.  
(c) **Guardrails (Default Prohibitions).** Unless both Parties agree otherwise in a signed writing delivered to the Independent Administrator, Party A shall not cause the Vehicle Account to:  
(i) use margin/leverage;  
(ii) engage in short selling;  
(iii) trade options, futures, swaps, or derivatives;  
(iv) purchase private placements or materially illiquid securities; or  
(v) hold any single non-index security position exceeding **[__]%** of Vehicle Account value at the applicable Valuation Time.  
(d) **Default Portfolio.** If the Parties do not agree on changes, the Vehicle Account remains invested in its then-current holdings, and new contributions shall be invested in **[Default Fund/Ticker]** (or a substantially similar successor as the Independent Administrator reasonably determines if the default becomes unavailable).  
(e) **Guardrail Breach Remedy (Limited to Pool).** If a final arbitration award determines Party A materially breached Section 3.4(c) and such breach materially impaired Vehicle Account value relative to a compliant posture, the arbitrator may order an in-pool true-up or setoff against Party A’s distribution under Section 7.2, limited strictly to assets in the Vehicle Account (and/or Joint Asset proceeds) and without recourse to Party A’s separate property.

### 3.5 Withdrawal Controls During Term (Anti-Smash-and-Grab)
During the Term, neither Party may unilaterally withdraw or transfer assets out of the Vehicle Account. Withdrawals, transfers-out, and distribution-related liquidations may be made only upon:  
(i) joint written instruction of both Parties delivered to the Independent Administrator; or  
(ii) ordinary administrative actions required by the custodian (fees, settlement, mandatory withholding required by law); or  
(iii) actions necessary to implement Administrator Events (including a protective freeze as described in Section 3.1B, transfers-out only).

### 3.6 Administrator Not Investment Advisor
The Independent Administrator is an administrative control and processing party only, and is not providing investment advice, tax advice, legal advice, portfolio management, or suitability determinations.

### 3.7 Admin Reserve; Pre-Funding of Administrator Costs (Fillability)
(a) **Reserve.** The Parties intend to maintain an Admin Reserve cash balance in the Vehicle Account of at least **$[____]** (recommended: **$[2,000–10,000]**) to cover the Independent Administrator’s fees and reasonable out-of-pocket costs.  
(b) **Authorization.** The Parties authorize the Independent Administrator to deduct unpaid, earned fees and expenses attributable to Administrator Events from the Vehicle Account prior to distribution, consistent with custodian policy and Exhibit 1.  
(c) **Minimum Liquidation.** If the Vehicle Account lacks sufficient cash to pay earned fees at the time due, the Independent Administrator may liquidate the minimum amount necessary (subject to Custodian Constraints) to pay such fees and costs.

---

## ARTICLE IV — ALLOCATION SCHEDULE (FORMULA FOR DIVIDING THE VEHICLE ACCOUNT)

### 4.1 Allocation Percentage Accrual
Party B’s Allocation Percentage shall accrue smoothly and incrementally on a monthly basis as provided in Section 4.2, subject to the cap in Section 4.3.

### 4.2 Accrual Rate
Party B’s Allocation Percentage accrues at a rate of **[1.00]%** per full calendar month during which this Agreement is operative and has not been terminated (i.e., during the Term).

### 4.3 Allocation Cap
This monthly accrual shall continue until Party B’s Allocation Percentage reaches a maximum cap of **[50.00]%**. Once the cap is reached, no further accrual occurs.

### 4.4 Measurement Rule
Allocation and entitlements are calculated using the Vehicle Account’s value at the applicable Valuation Time when a calculation is required (including a Liquidity Event, a mutually agreed withdrawal, a Joint Asset purchase, or the Termination Date).

### 4.5 B Distribution Ledger; Anti-Double-Counting; Event-Only Administration
(a) **Event-Only Ledger Duty.** The Independent Administrator’s ledger duty is limited to recording B Distributions actually executed under Administrator Events and does not require monthly reconciliations, performance tracking, or valuations outside the Valuation Times used for distributions.  
(b) **Anti-Double-Counting.** Any B Distribution executed under this Agreement shall be recorded in the B Distribution Ledger at the applicable Valuation Time. The B Distribution Ledger is used to ensure Party B does not receive more than Party B’s formulaic entitlement at Liquidity Events and at final termination.

### 4.6 No Clawback; No Negative Entitlement
Under no circumstances shall Party B owe money back to Party A, the Vehicle LLC, or the Vehicle Account due to subsequent market declines, valuation changes, or the timing of Liquidity distributions. All entitlement calculations use the `max(0, …)` structure stated in this Agreement.

### 4.7 No Recourse Outside the Vehicle Account
All allocations and entitlements in this Agreement are payable solely from assets actually held in the Vehicle Account (or from sale proceeds of Joint Assets purchased with Vehicle Account funds). Neither Party has any recourse against the other Party’s separate property for any claimed entitlement under this Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE V — VEHICLE ACCOUNT USE; PRO-RATA RULE; JOINT ASSETS

### 5.1 Mutually Agreed Withdrawals (Shared Goals)
The Parties may jointly agree to withdraw/distribute funds from the Vehicle Account for shared goals by joint written instruction to the Independent Administrator (a “Shared Withdrawal”).

### 5.2 Pro-Rata Deduction (Ledger Rule)
Each Shared Withdrawal reduces each Party’s economic interest in the Vehicle Account proportionally based on the Allocation Percentage at the applicable Valuation Time.  
If any portion of a Shared Withdrawal is expressly designated as a B Distribution, it shall be recorded in the B Distribution Ledger and must be transferred to Party B’s B Designated Account.

### 5.3 Joint Asset Purchases; Title and Governance
If Vehicle Account funds are used to purchase a Joint Asset, that Joint Asset shall be titled as Tenants in Common (or closest equivalent) with ownership percentages matching the Allocation Percentage at the applicable Valuation Time, unless the Parties agree otherwise in a signed writing (including titling to the Vehicle LLC). Governance, carrying costs, buyout rights, and sale procedures are governed by Exhibit 2.

---

## ARTICLE VI — MISAPPROPRIATION; DISPUTE HOLDBACK (NARROW)

### 6.1 Misappropriation from the Vehicle Account
If a Party is found by a final arbitration award (Article VIII) to have committed embezzlement, fraud, or intentional misappropriation from the Vehicle Account, the arbitrator may order appropriate reimbursement or setoff from that Party’s distribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, limited to the Vehicle Account (and/or Joint Asset proceeds) and without recourse to separate property.

### 6.2 Independent Administrator Not a Fact Finder
The Independent Administrator shall not adjudicate misconduct and shall act only upon a facially valid final arbitration award or court order.

---

## ARTICLE VII — TERMINATION; LIQUIDITY EVENTS; DETERMINISTIC UNWIND

### 7.1 Termination by Notice
Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time by delivering a Termination Notice to the other Party and to the Independent Administrator.

### 7.1A Deemed Termination Events (Objective Triggers)
Each of the following is a Deemed Termination Event and shall be treated as a Termination Date at the time it occurs:  
(a) death of either Party; or  
(b) written notice by both Parties that they have terminated this Agreement (email sufficient).

### 7.1B Marriage / Registered Domestic Partnership Trigger
If the Parties marry each other or enter into a registered domestic partnership (or substantially equivalent legal status) with each other, such event is a Deemed Termination Event as of the effective date of that status, unless the Parties sign a written amendment expressly stating this Agreement continues.

### 7.2 Deterministic Unwind Upon Termination (Mandatory Freeze and Distribution)
Upon the Termination Date, the Independent Administrator is irrevocably instructed to:  
(i) freeze the Vehicle Account as promptly as administratively possible (subject to Custodian Constraints),  
(ii) determine the Vehicle Account’s value as of the Valuation Time, and  
(iii) distribute the Vehicle Account within thirty (30) days (or as soon as reasonably practicable if delayed by settlement cycles, Custodian Constraints, legal restraint, or processing) as follows:

(a) **Party B’s Share (Net of Prior Distributions):**  
`max(0, (Vehicle Account value at Valuation Time × Party B’s Allocation Percentage as of the Termination Date) − (B Distribution Ledger balance as of the Termination Date))`.

(b) **Party A’s Share:**  
the remaining balance after payment of Party B’s Share and permitted deductions for unpaid fees/taxes attributable to the Vehicle Account as reflected in custodian records and/or required by Custodian Constraints.

**Death Handling:** If a Party is deceased, that Party’s share shall be distributed to that Party’s estate, trust, or designated legal recipient as directed by valid legal documentation provided to the Independent Administrator.

**Form of Distribution:** Distributions shall be made in cash unless (i) both Parties (or their legal representatives, if applicable) jointly instruct otherwise in writing, (ii) in-kind is required by Custodian Constraints, or (iii) in-kind is practicable and requested for Party B’s Share to Party B’s B Designated Account.

### 7.3 Scheduled Liquidity Event (Every Three Years)

#### 7.3.1 Liquidity Event Dates; Liquidity Window
Beginning on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Operative Date and on each three (3) year anniversary thereafter (each a Liquidity Event Date), Party B shall have a one-time election window of thirty (30) days (the Liquidity Window) to request a distribution of Party B’s then-earned allocated value under this Section 7.3, without terminating this Agreement.

#### 7.3.2 Liquidity Election
Party B may deliver a written election during the Liquidity Window (a Liquidity Election) to the Independent Administrator specifying:  
(i) Party B’s B Designated Account for any in-kind distribution; and  
(ii) any reasonable operational preferences permitted by Custodian Constraints.

#### 7.3.3 Liquidity Valuation
For Liquidity Events, Valuation Time is measured as of the most recent trading day ending prior to the Liquidity Event Date.

#### 7.3.4 Liquidity Settlement Amount (Net of Prior Distributions)
Upon a timely Liquidity Election, the Independent Administrator shall calculate:  
`Liquidity Settlement Amount = max(0, (Vehicle Account value at Liquidity Valuation Time × Party B’s Allocation Percentage as of the Liquidity Event Date) − (B Distribution Ledger balance as of the Liquidity Event Date))`.

#### 7.3.5 Mandatory Processing Upon Election
Upon a timely Liquidity Election, the Independent Administrator shall distribute the Liquidity Settlement Amount within thirty (30) days (or as soon as reasonably practicable if delayed by settlement cycles or Custodian Constraints), without requiring further consent from Party A.

#### 7.3.6 Form of Liquidity Distribution (Own-the-Asset Default; Custodian Constraints Control)
(a) **Default In-Kind (If Practicable).** Unless impracticable due to Custodian Constraints, the Liquidity Settlement Amount shall be distributed in kind (securities) to the B Designated Account.  
(b) **Cash Fallback.** If in-kind distribution is not practicable, the Independent Administrator may liquidate the minimum amount necessary and distribute cash to the B Designated Account.  
(c) **Pro-Rata / Reasonable Equalization.** In-kind distributions should be pro rata across holdings to the extent reasonably practicable, with reasonable rounding or cash-in-lieu for fractional shares.

#### 7.3.7 Ledger Update; No Double Counting
The Independent Administrator shall increase the B Distribution Ledger by the Liquidity Settlement Amount (valued at Liquidity Valuation Time) immediately upon completing the Liquidity distribution.

#### 7.3.8 No Reset of Allocation
A Liquidity distribution does not reset or slow allocation accrual. Party B’s Allocation Percentage continues to accrue per Article IV (subject to the cap), and future Liquidity/Termination payouts are computed net of the B Distribution Ledger.

#### 7.3.9 Optionality
Party B is not required to elect a Liquidity distribution. If Party B does not elect within the Liquidity Window, no Liquidity distribution is made for that Liquidity Event Date, and the next Liquidity Event Date occurs as scheduled.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — DISPUTE RESOLUTION (AAA; EXPEDITED; SMALL CLAIMS; EMERGENCY RELIEF; CARVE-OUTS)

### 8.1 Holdback for Disputes Affecting Distribution
If either Party disputes any issue that would change the distribution amounts (including alleged misappropriation, guardrail breach remedies under Section 3.4(e), or ledger disputes), the Independent Administrator shall distribute undisputed amounts promptly and hold back only the disputed incremental amount pending resolution.

### 8.2 Binding Arbitration (AAA; Expedited)
Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Vehicle Account, the B Distribution Ledger, the Vehicle LLC implementation covenants (including Sections 3.1A–3.1B), Section 3.4(e) remedies, or any Joint Asset purchased with Vehicle Account funds shall be resolved by expedited, binding private arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules (including expedited procedures where applicable) in **[County, State]**.

### 8.2A Small-Claims Carveout
Notwithstanding Section 8.2, either Party may bring an individual action in small claims court (or equivalent) for disputes within that court’s jurisdictional limit, provided the action seeks only money relief within the limit and does not seek to alter Vehicle Account control other than enforcement of this Agreement’s deterministic formulas.

### 8.3 Carve-Outs (Court Allowed for Emergency Relief and Enforcement)
Notwithstanding Section 8.2, either Party may seek in court:  
(a) temporary injunctive relief necessary to preserve the status quo (including enforcing a freeze or preventing dissipation) pending arbitration; and  
(b) confirmation, enforcement, or vacatur of an arbitration award.

### 8.4 Fees and Costs (Balanced)
(a) AAA filing/administrative fees and arbitrator compensation shall be advanced 50/50 unless the arbitrator determines otherwise for good cause.  
(b) Each Party bears their own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitrator finds bad faith, willful breach, or fee-shifting is required by applicable law. If awarded, fees must be reasonable.  
(c) The arbitrator may award reasonable arbitration costs (excluding attorneys’ fees unless awarded under subsection (b))) as justice requires.

### 8.5 Confidentiality of Proceedings (Light Touch)
To the maximum extent permitted by law and AAA rules, the Parties agree to treat arbitration filings, testimony, hearing materials, and any award as confidential as between themselves, subject to permitted disclosures to counsel and professional advisors, disclosures required by law or court order, and disclosures reasonably necessary to enforce or defend this Agreement or an award.

---

## ARTICLE IX — TAX AND REPORTING (TAX-NEUTRAL; NON-ADVICE)

### 9.1 No Promise of Characterization; Forms Follow Titling and Law
The Parties acknowledge that brokers/custodians and taxing authorities determine tax forms and reporting based on account titling, entity classification, regulations, and facts. This Agreement does not promise or guarantee that any particular tax form (e.g., 1099, K-1, 1041, or other) will or will not be issued to any Party.

### 9.2 Entity Classification and Reporting May Vary
The Vehicle LLC may be treated as a disregarded entity for certain tax purposes or as a separate reporting entity depending on elections and law. The Parties acknowledge that:  
(a) custodian reporting may be issued to the Vehicle LLC, Party A, or as otherwise required; and  
(b) distributions from the Vehicle Account may be reported in different ways depending on facts, law, and custodian practice.

### 9.3 Allocation Formula Is Economic; Not a Tax Allocation
The Allocation Percentage and deterministic payout formulas are economic governance mechanics. They do not, by themselves, determine federal, state, or local tax characterization, timing, or allocation of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit.

### 9.4 Cooperation and Information Sharing
To the extent reasonably necessary for accurate reporting and compliance (as advised by each Party’s independent tax counsel), each Party agrees to cooperate in good faith, including by providing:  
(a) taxpayer identification information reasonably required for forms;  
(b) confirmations of amounts distributed and dates; and  
(c) copies of relevant custodian statements pertaining to distributions executed under this Agreement.

### 9.5 Withholding, Fees, and Transaction Costs
Custodians may impose withholding, fees, and transaction costs and may require liquidation to fund cash distributions. Any such withholding, fees, and transaction costs borne by the Vehicle Account reduce the net value available for distribution as reflected on custodian records, subject to Custodian Constraints.

### 9.6 No Tax Advice
Each Party acknowledges they have been advised to consult independent tax counsel regarding reporting obligations arising from deposits, trading activity, allocations, and distributions, including any potential gift tax reporting, income tax reporting, and nominee/beneficial-owner reporting if applicable.

Except for the Independent Administrator’s rights and protections expressly stated herein and in Exhibit 1, this Agreement creates no rights in any third party.

# EXHIBIT 1 — INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATOR INSTRUCTIONS  
*(Event-Only; Hardened — LLC Vehicle; Conformed to V3)*

If the custodian requires its own forms, these instructions are intended to be incorporated into or mirrored by those forms. The Independent Administrator’s duties are limited to Administrator Events and do not include day-to-day account monitoring, monthly reconciliations, or investment oversight.

## 1. Parties; Vehicle LLC; Account
Party A: [Name; Email; Address]  
Party B: [Name; Email; Address]  
Independent Administrator: [Name; Email; Address]  
Vehicle LLC: [Name; State of Formation]  
Vehicle Account Identifier: [Account Number / Custodian]

## 2. Authority During Term (Event-Only)
(a) **Exclusive Transfers-Out / Distributions.** Except as expressly permitted herein, no withdrawal, transfer-out, liquidation for distribution, or distribution shall be processed unless the Independent Administrator executes it pursuant to an Administrator Event.  
(b) **Party A Trading Authority Only.** Party A may have Trading Authority only. Party A shall have no authority to withdraw, transfer out, distribute, pledge, encumber, borrow against, or otherwise move value out of the Vehicle Account.  
(c) **Party B Access (Default View-Only).** Unless the custodian requires otherwise, Party B’s access (if any) shall be view-only.

## 3. Notices; Deemed Effectiveness; Alternative Service
The Independent Administrator may rely on the deemed effective time set forth in Section 2.4 of the Agreement and is not required to confirm actual receipt by the other Party. If the Independent Administrator receives an arbitration award or court order authorizing alternative service under Section 2.5, the Independent Administrator may rely on notices, orders, or awards delivered using such authorized method.

## 4. Ledger Duty (Event-Only)
The Independent Administrator shall maintain the **B Distribution Ledger** by recording only **B Distributions** actually executed under Administrator Events, valued at the applicable Valuation Time. The Independent Administrator has no duty to perform ongoing valuations, monthly accounting, or performance reporting.

## 5. Liquidity Event Processing
Upon receipt of a timely **Liquidity Election** within the Liquidity Window, the Independent Administrator shall:  
(i) determine Vehicle Account value at Liquidity Valuation Time,  
(ii) calculate the Liquidity Settlement Amount per Section 7.3.4,  
(iii) distribute per Section 7.3.6 within the timeframe required by Section 7.3.5 **to Party B’s B Designated Account**, and  
(iv) update the B Distribution Ledger per Section 7.3.7.

## 6. Termination Processing
Upon receipt of an effective Termination Notice or Deemed Termination Event, the Independent Administrator shall:  
(i) freeze the Vehicle Account as promptly as administratively possible (subject to Custodian Constraints),  
(ii) determine Vehicle Account value at Valuation Time,  
(iii) distribute per Section 7.2 (net of the B Distribution Ledger), including delivering Party B’s Share **to Party B’s B Designated Account** unless Custodian Constraints require another form, and  
(iv) update the B Distribution Ledger.

## 7. Holdback for Disputes
If the Independent Administrator receives written notice that a dispute exists concerning an issue that would change distribution amounts, the Independent Administrator shall distribute undisputed amounts and hold back only the disputed incremental amount until it receives (A) joint written direction, or (B) a final arbitration award or court order.

## 8. Form of Distribution / Custodian Constraints
Distributions shall be made in cash unless (i) in-kind is required or practicable as specified in the Agreement, or (ii) Custodian Constraints require otherwise. In-kind distributions shall be pro rata across holdings to the extent reasonably practicable, with cash-in-lieu for fractional shares where needed. All B Distributions must be delivered to Party B’s **B Designated Account**.

## 9. Fees (Pre-Authorized; Admin Reserve)
(a) Fee Schedule (choose one or attach a schedule):  
- [ ] Hourly: $[__]/hour plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.  
- [ ] Per Event: $[__] per Liquidity distribution; $[__] per Termination unwind; plus expenses.  
- [ ] Attached Schedule: [Attach].  

(b) Payment Source. The Parties authorize the Independent Administrator to deduct unpaid, earned fees and expenses attributable to Administrator Events from the Vehicle Account prior to distribution, consistent with custodian policy.  
(c) Admin Reserve. The Parties intend to maintain Admin Reserve per Section 3.7.

## 11. Limitation of Liability; Indemnity
The Independent Administrator shall not be liable to either Party except for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

## 12. Resignation; Successor
The Independent Administrator may resign upon 30 days’ written notice to both Parties. The Parties shall appoint a successor within 60 days. If no successor is appointed within 60 days, the Independent Administrator may (a) continue as a courtesy (not required), or (b) freeze actionable distributions other than those required by law until a successor is appointed or a final arbitration award/court order directs further action.

## 13. Compliance with Law and Custodian Rules
Nothing requires the Independent Administrator or custodian to violate applicable law, regulatory requirements, or custodian policy. If a conflict arises, the Independent Administrator shall use reasonable efforts to implement the Agreement’s intent consistent with such requirements.

## 14. Acceptance
These instructions are effective only upon written acceptance by the Independent Administrator.

# EXHIBIT 2 — JOINT ASSET PROTOCOL (INCLUDING LLC-TITLED OPTION)
*(Conformed to V3; LLC-titling treated as advanced mode)*

## Purpose
This protocol governs Joint Assets purchased in whole or in part with Vehicle Account funds.

**Implementation Note (Simplification Preference).** LLC-Titled assets are optional “advanced mode.” Default practice is Tenants-in-Common titling where feasible, because it is simpler to implement and audit. If the Parties elect LLC titling, they should ensure the Vehicle LLC documents clearly authorize sale/buyout steps consistent with Exhibit 4.

## 1. Definitions
(a) **Joint Asset** means any vehicle, real estate, or other tangible asset purchased with Vehicle Account funds.  
(b) **Ownership Percentages** means the Parties’ tenants-in-common percentages set at purchase, matching the Allocation Percentage at the applicable Valuation Time, unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
(c) **LLC-Titled Asset** means a Joint Asset titled in the name of the Vehicle LLC pursuant to a signed written election by both Parties.

## 2. Titling (Default = Tenants in Common)
(a) **Default.** Each Joint Asset shall be titled as Tenants in Common (or closest equivalent). If title cannot reflect percentages, the Parties shall sign a memorandum at purchase stating Ownership Percentages and keep it with this Exhibit.  
(b) **Optional LLC Titling.** The Parties may elect in a signed writing to title a Joint Asset in the name of the Vehicle LLC (an “LLC Titling Election”). If so titled, the asset is an LLC-Titled Asset and Section 7 applies.

## 3. Carrying Costs; Reimbursement (TIC Assets)
(a) Default: ongoing carrying costs (insurance, taxes, registration, ordinary maintenance) are paid pro rata to Ownership Percentages unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
(b) Reimbursement: if one Party pays more than their pro rata share, the excess is a reimbursable advance owed by the other Party within thirty (30) days after written notice with documentation, unless netted against sale proceeds.

## 4. Insurance; Liability Control (Vehicles Especially)
(a) Vehicles must be insured at commercially reasonable levels.  
(b) The Party primarily operating/possessing the vehicle shall be responsible for tickets, violations, and at-fault deductibles, unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
(c) Both Parties shall cooperate to keep the vehicle insurable and to avoid uninsured operation.

## 5. Use and Possession (Minimal)
Unless otherwise agreed in writing:  
(a) Vehicles: shared reasonable use; if conflict, the Parties agree a schedule; failing agreement, the Party who is the registered/insured primary operator has temporary priority use pending sale/buyout, subject to reasonable access for the other Party.  
(b) Non-residence real estate: use by mutual agreement; failing agreement, proceed to sale/buyout.

## 6. Termination: Buyout First; Forced Sale Second (TIC Assets)
Upon Termination Date for a Joint Asset titled as tenants in common:

**Step 1 — Buyout Option (30-day election).** Within 30 days after Termination Date, either Party may elect to buy the other Party’s interest at FMV × selling Party’s Ownership Percentage, less documented reimbursable advances.

**FMV Determination:**  
- Vehicles: average of two reputable valuation sources or a dealer written offer.  
- Real estate/other: one independent appraiser agreed by the Parties; if no agreement within 10 days, each Party selects an appraiser and FMV is the average.

**Closing:** buyout closes within 60 days after FMV is determined.

**Step 2 — Forced Sale.** If no buyout election is made, or buyout does not close on time, the Joint Asset shall be sold to a third party using commercially reasonable methods (broker listing for real estate; dealer/consignment for vehicles), with reasonable price reductions if needed.

**Net Proceeds:** net sale proceeds (after liens, selling costs, taxes attributable to sale, and reimbursable advances) distributed pro rata to Ownership Percentages.

## 7. LLC-Titled Assets (If Titled to Vehicle LLC)
If an asset is an LLC-Titled Asset:

(a) **Governance.** The Parties agree that the Vehicle LLC holds legal title for administrative convenience only, and the Parties’ economic interests in the net value of the LLC-Titled Asset are tracked by the Allocation Percentage (and the B Distribution Ledger where applicable), consistent with this Agreement.  
(b) **Sale or Buyout Process.** Upon Termination Date (or upon mutual written agreement), the Independent Administrator is authorized to direct commercially reasonable steps (subject to Custodian Constraints and legal requirements) for the Vehicle LLC to sell the LLC-Titled Asset or to effect a buyout to one Party, and to cause net proceeds (after liens, selling costs, taxes attributable to sale, and reimbursable advances) to be transferred into the Vehicle Account and treated as Vehicle Account value for purposes of Section 7.2 distribution mechanics.  
(c) **No Separate Equity Claim.** Party B acknowledges that titling an asset to the Vehicle LLC does not make Party B a member of the Vehicle LLC and does not create any ownership interest in the Vehicle LLC itself.

## 8. Negative Equity
If a Joint Asset is sold for less than outstanding lien(s), the shortfall is borne pro rata to Ownership Percentages unless the lien arose from unilateral borrowing or misconduct by one Party, in which case that Party bears the incremental shortfall.

4) **Anti-Bypass**

5) **Administrator Reliance**  
The Independent Administrator may rely on facially valid notices and awards/orders and has no duty to investigate facts beyond documents received.

6) **Fees**  
The Independent Administrator’s fee terms in Exhibit 1 are pre-authorized to be paid from the Vehicle Account consistent with custodian policy.

7) **Successor Mechanism**  
If the Independent Administrator resigns, the Parties must appoint a successor within 60 days. If no successor is appointed, distributions may be frozen as provided in Exhibit 1 until successor appointment or a final award/order directs further action.

8) **LLC-Titled Asset Authority (If Elected)**  
If the Parties elect LLC-titling for any Joint Asset under Exhibit 2, the Vehicle LLC’s governing documents shall authorize commercially reasonable sale and/or buyout steps at termination as described in Exhibit 2, Section 7, subject to applicable law and Custodian Constraints, and shall permit the net proceeds to be transferred into the Vehicle Account for treatment under Section 7.2.
